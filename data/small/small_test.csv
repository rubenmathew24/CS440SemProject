"Loud: Good speakers.  I am not a very savy type person so the only thing that I was not to impressed was the customer service line.

They work but you have to flip your mattress to place them: I didn‚Äôt think them through.

"Handy chart for testing kids eyesight: Me and my husband wear glasses, so there is a strong probability that our kids will need them eventually. This is a good tool to use at home to periodically check on when to bring them in to see an optometrist. As a child I didn't get glasses until I was in 2nd grade and it was evident that I needed them sooner. There just wasn't a good way for my parent to know. I feel more confident that we will be able to catch any decline in my kids sight having this on hand.<br /><br />I would suggest storing it flat and pressed for a while after opening. It is still curled a bit, but it did improve.<br /><br />I plan to keep this in storage, stored flat, in between screenings. This gives it a better chance to flatten out and prevents the kids from memorizing the shapes.<br /><br />Overall this is pretty cute and useful, just a but harder to get the curl out than expected. 4/5",4.0,Industrial_and_Scientific,1,19

"Great tablet: I'm typing this review on the A500 now. I was deciding between an Ipad2 (and had actually purchased one), an Asus Transformer, and the A500. I became frustrated with the limitations of the Ipad 2, and once it became clear that the Asus Tranformer wouldn't have adequate stock for weeks, I decided to give the A500 a try. No regrets, and I ended up returning the Ipad2.<br /><br />Why this is better than an I pad 2 -<br />- Micro SD card slot gives this all the memory you practically need with just a 16 gb model. Cards are cheap - you can get a 32 gb card for $50. No card slot on the I pad 2.<br />- USB port makes file transferring easy. You can plug in external flash drives or a USB keyboard. Yes, it has a USB host port so it can externally power or charge devices through the port. No USB on the I pad 2 without buying a $30 adapter.<br />-HDMI port - easy projection to your HDTV. The A500 screen has about the same aspect ratio as most HDTVs, so you will be able to take full advantage of the area on your HDTV. With the Ipad2, you need a separate $39 adapter for this, plus the IPad 2 screen is a different aspect ratio than most HDTVs.<br />-Android Honeycomb is way better than Apple iOS. It's much more customizable and supports true multitasking. Yes, iOS has a simpler, dumber interface that your grandma can use, but for me it is too simple and limited. Plus, with Honeycomb you are not chained to using ITunes to manage your content. You can just plug it into the USB port of your PC and manage files like you would any external USB drive.<br />-If you use Google applications like Gmail, Picasa, Docs, Maps, Youtube, etc., the integration is excellent. You log in with your Gmail account and all your Google data is synched to the device within minutes.<br /><br />Don't believe the reviews about lack on apps for Honeycomb or frequent crashes. I have had almost no issues in a week of use. Most of the apps for Android smartphones I tried work fine and there are over 65,000 of them now. The Android market is better than the Apple market because there are a lot more free apps.<br /><br />Because of the USB port this is a better value than the Transformer too, which doesn't have USB port without the separate docking station.<br /><br />This is a fast, powerful tablet, great screen, long battery life (I'm getting two days with normal use). A good value.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE 10/20/11: Had the A500 tablet for 6 months. Netflix works on it now, and it got an update that enabled Skype and Google Video Chat as well. The OS updates to Android 3.1 and 3.2 made it run faster and smoother. However, after the Android 3.1 update the microphone sound got pretty muffled to the point that video chatting or using it as a camcorder became pretty poor. I would have to speak rather loudly or directly into the speaker for it to get picked up. I checked around online and this seems to be a problem that many people have experienced due to the OS update on their A500 tablets. There were rumors that the Android 3.2 update would fix the problem, but this didn't happen. I downgraded from 5 stars to 4 stars because of this.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the Android Honeycomb tablet experience and not regretting returning the IPad, but I wanted something that would work flawlessly for video chatting. So I purchased an Asus Transformer, updated it to Android 3.2, and tried out the microphone, and it worked fine. So I ended up selling my A500 and am using the Transformer now instead. Had the microphone worked flawlessly, the A500 is still the better tablet in my mind than the Transformer due to the full-sized USB port and the metal construction, but they are pretty close. If you don't plan to use the microphone I think the A500 is still the better deal. But Asus seems to do a better job of pushing out OS updates.<br /><br />I recommend you'all take a serious look at the Honeycomb tablets. There are many available now, all pretty close in specs, for much better prices than IPads and they are more versatile. With the upcoming launch of Android 4.0, the operating systems for smartphones and tablets will be unified, which will make many more apps useable on the tablets. Just like Android smartphones eventually blew away the IPhone in market share, Android tablets will do the same to IPads someday, I am confident.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Good price, awkward fit: I like this for the price they paid, but the cut is a little awkward.  I was confused on how to arrange it after putting it on. I looked at a picture and I still feel like it sits a little funny.  It does not equally cover both sides of your body. It sets more to one side.  I wish there was just a little more length to it. The hanging in the neck is strange.  It does not lay completely flat, but there is not enough loose fabric to make it hang naturally.  That open design on the edging is sort of stamped out of the fabric.  It‚Äôs  more like a rectangular  poncho rather than a square poncho. I just feel like it lays funny. The fringe at the bottom does not go around the entire garment.  But again, I will keep it and wear it for the amount I paid. It was reasonable.  The fabric isn‚Äôt super thin. So that‚Äôs nice.  All in all I‚Äôm satisfied.",3.0,Amazon_Fashion,0,1

Beware of optima battery  warranty.  There is none.  They don't last: I purchased an Optima battery on Amazon 8010-044 6V RedTop Starting Battery.

"Fantastic! Definitely worth the money!: This product worked great for us.  We traveled from Orlando, Fl to Indianapolis and back with very heavy rain and everything stayed dry.

We fit a large suitcase, large duffel, medium duffle, CPAP machine, pillows, and a small suitcase and still had room.  It's not anti-theft so we did take it down overnight at a hotel overnight.  It folds up into a 1 foot by 1 foot square of smaller.  The RoofBag website offers duffel bags designed to fit in the carrier.  We didn't have time to order them, but we may in the future.

Not bad: I see a lot of people complaining about the smell and it's not a great smell for sure but it's not overwhelming.  Somehow the texture of it starts like a pork rind and ends like a rice cake which is kind of cool honestly.  I wouldn't write home about the taste...it certainly exists.  Again like a rice cake with a very low key fishy after taste.  I don't regret my order cause it was a cool thing to try but not a well I'm headed back to soon.,3.0,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,0,14

Another failure from China: Got the docking station for both my Samsung Note and Galaxy tab. It was shipped as promised and packaged well.

"welp :/: as I'm doing this review the price I paid is 35.00 for the base, which is the same cost of a new echo dot now.<br />well it was great that it arrived on time<br />the batteries are not easily removable so therefore you have to charge it with the cord for the echo dot.<br />The base did not come with a charger but it did come with a little ""Thank You"" card that said I have a free warranty. That's a plus I guess. from my first use it didn't seem to have a long lasting battery. I took both the charger and echo dot outside from my house while walking my dog excited, I guess I strayed to far from my WI-FI to the point the echo cuts off and I couldn't even connect Bluetooth while away. so you need WI-FI or just only walk around the house. it does the job in a short time.",3.0,Electronics,0,12

"You will need at least 4-5 bundles: I posted pictures of the hair in different states.  The only thing I really dislike is how thin the bundles are.  I ordered 3 bundles 20, 22 & 24 however because the bundles were so thin I ended up having to purchase a 26 inch bundle from my local beauty supply store because I was getting a sewin  done that day. Also I did notice black residue on my wand curlers when I curled the hair . I know it was from Amelia bundles because the residue came off when I curled the top part as well. It curled pretty good tho but was puffy looking however the curls came back when I washed it just looser. Other than that surprisingly I haven't had any major issues with shedding in fact I haven't noticed much shedding at all. This hair doesn't tangle much  for it to be curly hair. On a scale of 1-5 I would say the tangling is probably a 2.5 . I do detangle it prior to shampoo/ conditioning it and then I use a deep curly define cream which has the curls popping even when it dries. For the price you pay it's worth it to me besides the thin bundles.  My advice would be to not over do it with  products  and maybe wash it twice a week defining the curls with a define curl cream so you won't have to deal with it everyday. I purchased this hair  on 10/13, It came over night 10/14, Got it installed later that day and I still have it in as of today which is 11/3. It will probably last you a good 1-3 months with proper care. You will need about 4-5 bundles maybe even 6 if you want a full look.",4.0,Beauty_and_Personal_Care,1,6

"Invaluable method for guitar soloing!!: ""Chord tone soloing for jazz guitar"" is an excellent study for those guitarists that want to spice up their solos by emphasizing the tones of each chord in any chord progression.  Joseph Alexander's presents this method with a clear introduction of what the book is about and then starts in easy gradually gets the concepts chord soloing.  You'll immediately see the value of connecting to each chord by its tones and the wonderful effect it has in your soloing.  I'm actually still working out of the book.

"Looks cool, but didn't last: When I first hung them outside I was skeptical. Idea was they'd charge during the day and I'd come home to dancing fire at night. For a few days they did charge up and look cool. The dancing fire effect looks better at a distance, but up close they helped illuminate my door in the dark. Depending on how cloudy the day was they only lasted a few hours at best into the night.<br /><br />After just a couple weeks though, I noticed they hardly charged at all. Now I haven't seen them light up at all lately. Very disappointed they only lasted a couple weeks and basically useless junk now. Really loved the idea of them.
