Read it in one day!: Such a great read. I've been waiting for this author write another book and she didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Julia and Miles were great characters. I loved their chemistry and how much humor she put into their characters. The book was book funny and then would turn on a dime and bring so much emotion. I love her writing style and can't wait to read her future work.  If you haven't read her first two books you should check them out.,5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"cheep materials but long for tall ladies. small in the arms but not in the torso.: so the thing about this jacket- i usually wear a size XL in blazers and this said it fit somewhat small, which i know know why. its not that the jacket itself is small it is that the sleeves are slim so if you are a busty lady with slim arms this is PERFECT (with the exception of the lining which was not done correctly at all.) the material is cheep and so is the lining- so if i were to buy this again i would pay $20 for it and not the $49 i spent on it. the color is good i had gotten a 1X and i am glad i did. the arms fit well but i have to take it in around the waist area or i will look like i am swimming in it. on the plus side it you are looking for a long jacket this is the one for you. i am not a petite size but  this was a few inches longer that i probably would have liked.",3.0,Unknown,0,32

A cute tape dispenser: I bout this as a gift for a teacher friend who loved cats. I thought this would be cute on her desk.

"A review from inside: The following excerpts are from a review posted at charlesapril.com by Gabriel Schechter:<br />Of the Hall of Fame's three missions--""preserving history, honoring greatness, connecting generations""--the last has always seemed the most important to me. When I worked at the Hall of Fame's library from 2002-2010, my own mission focused on helping visitors, many of whom regarded their visit to Cooperstown as a once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage to baseball's mecca, celebrate their own connections to the sport. . .I know of no single object that represents the joys of baseball connection more than The Hall Ball, so designated by Ralph Carhart and celebrated in his book of the same title.  Do yourself a favor and share in Carhart's extraordinary quest to use one object--a used baseball his wife, Anna, spotted in the creek that runs past Doubleday Field during their own 2010 pilgrimage to Cooperstown--to unite all of the members of the Hall of Fame. What did Ralph Carhart do? The book's subtitle is apt: ""One Fan's Journey to Unite Cooperstown Immortals with a Single Baseball."" He set out to photograph that baseball, with THE HALL BALL its lone adornment, in the hands of every living Hall of Famer and at the gravesite of every deceased one. This eight-year quest ultimately saw him seek out and immortalize all but a handful of the 323 Hall of Famers when he turned in 2018 from the quest to chronicling it in this terrific book. . .How many baseball fans would go to that much trouble to make such meaningful connections with people he could never know? Ralph Carhart did it, and he tells the story in a book that abounds with neat details that make his journey seem both intensely personal and ultimately universal. He takes us along with him all the way, as the thing takes on a life of its own, a wide-open daydream at the start, hardened by travel and other difficulties and fueled by epiphanies and endless connections, eventually dwindling down to the end of the list (except for just a handful of White Whales). . .Whether Carhart got what he wanted in a few minutes or it took hours, we know how he felt about it. I knew nothing about The Hall Ball before this year, but now I feel like I've known Ralph and Anna Carhart for a long time, and that is a decidedly good thing. You'll be glad to share in their travels as they prove once again that in a long trip toward a distant goal, what you experience along the way is far more vivid and rewarding than what awaits you at the end. Fittingly, what Carhart expected to happen to The Hall Ball did not happen, and The Hall Ball ends with that artifact headed for a place that seems just as perfect as its journey.<br /><br />That's all, and it's still just a portion of the review. You should read it too!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />GS",5.0,Books,1,7

"Works, but do not recommend for Presta valve: This pump is bad at presta valve inflation.<br /><br />I was able to convert it from Schrader, that wasn't too hard... although I had to slightly stretch the spring in removing it.<br /><br />When using for presta: The sealing part is miss-sized (it fits too tightly) making it physically quite hard to put on-and-off the valve. When inflating pressures above 90psi, the pump is hard to push down, and tends to wobble under force. The final problem is when removing the pump from the valve after inflation, the miss-sized seal in the head is difficult to pull off the valve, and lots of air leaks out. While this pump works, I do not recommend it.",2.0,Unknown,0,32

(I can't get the iTunes 64 to install - I think because I have MS Office 32 bit and other 32 bit APPS but no one seems to know for sure)<br /><br />The iPAD documentation with the mini2 is so scarce it is impossible to know what you have until you get on line and update software.

"The photos are fantastic, but beware some of the procedures.: I purchased his book, for several reasons.  I have suffered from lower lumbar back pain for 40 years.  Forty years ago, the Veterans Administration Hospital strongly recommended surgery. And meanwhile provided grocery bags of pain killers.<br /><br />But I also lived and worked in an African village for two years. I knew Esther was on the right track. The functional posture and strength of both men and woman in the tribe in which I lived, was  awesome. Esther's photographs beautifully capture the functional strength and poise that I witnessed many years ago.<br /><br />I bought this book with great hopes. Sadly, some of the ideas in this book only injured my back further.<br /><br />But I can also say the same for the dozens of &#34;back books&#34; and seminars which I have read or attended over forty years. Whether the subject is Tai Chi, Yoga, or Pilates, I always find that some exercises seem to help, but there are unhappily always a few exercises that do further injury. And there is the rub.<br /><br />I am also amazed that Esther does not show the ancient &#34;village squat.&#34; This is a glaring omission. A westerner can not live, or travel, in the 3rd world and not observe the ease and frequency with which villagers - young and old - can assume the village squat.<br />Generally, Westerners just can't seem to squat like this for any length of time.  I am mystified that this functional and popular position is not captured in her photographs.<br /><br />I would love to see Esther take her beautiful - but beginning research - a step further.<br /><br />Thankfully, I eventually found right here - at Amazon - some back books and DVD's which have given me relief from back pain for the first time in 40 years  - as well as a new found ability to run and ice skate again.<br /><br />Admittedly, my search was a long journey, but I found the best self help yet in the books and DVD's of Peter Egoscue.  Book by book, I became so impressed with the results, that I eventually bought every book and DVD Peter has written or produced.<br /><br />My back problems are largely confined to the lower lumbar area, due to injuries sustained in Vietnam in 1970.<br /><br />Ironically, Peter Egoscue is also a Vietnam veteran who sustained injuries while on duty. Peter embarked on his own search to heal himself.<br /><br />What a marvelous, simple and sound approach he has pioneered.  Not one of Peter egoscue's procedures has ever caused my back further injury or pain!<br /><br />In response to the one negative comment I received, may I affirm and clarify that my back injuries are serious - due to substantial injuries sustained in Vietnam. I do recognize that many other people will be well served by Esther's exercises.<br /><br />But, I also wish to extend a hopeful hand to those whose injuries are severe, life long, and who so far may have found only partial or intermittent help with the many modalities of back treatment that have developed over the past 40 years.<br /><br />In addition, to the books and DVD's I recommended above, I now wish to one more book that I earlier withheld - due to its price. &#34;Rehabilitation of The Spine: A Practitioner's Manual&#34; by Craig Liebsenson. Available here on Amazon.<br /><br />Yes, the price is edgy! But this book is a must have for anyone who experiences chronic and severe back difficulties. A magnificent and clearly articulated review of all of the current treatment modalities available in the mainstream as well as the alternative medical fields today. Pay attention to what Dr Vladimir Janda is doing to treat patients in Czechoslovakia.<br /><br />Ok. A couple years later, and I wish to add another writer, especially for those persons with serious injuries - sports related or work related. I discovered the fellow who has co-authored more than 300 clinical published studies on the back and spine.  He is a fountainhead of knowledge for trainers and rehab experts alike. He is quoted by the best of the best trainers regularly. Two of his books -  directed toward the medical professional ---  are available here on Amazon. &#34;Low Back Disorders&#34; and &#34;Ultimate Back Fitness & Performance&#34;  by Stuart McGill, PhD.<br /><br />His research methods are exquisite.  He busts more fitness myths than any writer I have yet read - and he does this with science based data, much of it derived from his own labs. I must caution that he writes to the trainer and rehab audience. But his writing is extremely clear to me, a lay person. Nearly every page in the first half of book, &#34;Low Back Disorders,&#34; is filled with lab evidence as to why so much of what your coach, your drill instructor, your fitness guru, and / or the muscles mags are saying is simply dangerous or wrong.  This half steers you away from incredibly dangerous , but popular routines. That knowledge alone is worth a lot.<br /><br />As you will recognize in all of his books and DVD's, Dr Stuart McGill works with the highest performing world class athletes.<br /><br />He also publishes two DVD's which I have not found here on Amazon.<br /><br />Once again, good luck with your own search for back health.<br /><br />Added, Sep 11, 2016<br />Are you folks  aware that Dr Stuart McGill has finally released a new book.  His first book in his 30+ year career, now intended to help the lay person? Everyday folks.<br /><br />Having read all of Dr McGill's books and watched all of his DVD's -- which are geared toward the professional, I can now say that this new book, &#34;Back Mechanic&#34; is the best written and edited, the best produced and best illustrated of all his books.<br /><br />I presented a copy of this book to an attending Physician at  the local Veteran's Medical Center, Department of Rehabilitative medicine.<br />I told her I might recommend this book to other veterans. But first would like to hear her own opinion. Do you think these ideas will case any harm?<br />Do you think these ideas will help veterans?<br /><br />She got back to me, &#34;I love it! It is so easy to read. So easy for the veteran to understand.  I have received approval from the Department Director to make this book available to all of my veteran patients. We are now seeking the funding from the Education Department.<br /><br />It was released just recently.<br />Available at Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Back-Mechanic-Dr-Stuart-McGill/dp/0973501820<br /><br />Most importantly, for the first time Dr McGill has included a self diagnosis procedure, so that every day persons can hopefully determine the major causes and/or sources of their back pain.<br />The book covers rehabilitation remedies that address each particular diagnosis.<br /><br />I can say that having read all of his prior books and learned so much, I am now learning even more in this beautiful edition. The illustrations are clear and extensive.<br /><br />Once again, Stuart McGill dispels so many sports rehabilitation myths and legends. He lays bare many surprising details that are truly harmful to a healthy back. And describes in detail the way back to real recovery.<br /><br />I am only a bit more than 1/2 way through it.<br />I deliberately set a slow pace. Stopping to try out his techniques and his self diagnosis strategies.<br /><br />We are fortunate to have the wisdom of this man who has spent decades in his research laboratory as well as his rehabilitation facility. He has worked with the world's top elite athletes for all of these decades, as well as everyday folks who are injured.<br /><br />This book may become the classic in its field. The starting place.<br /><br />I will may write a review and post it when I have finished reading the entire book.<br /><br />Good luck.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Not sure I received what I ordered, package was open and seems light duty for a 110 lb. dog: This is the first retractable dog leash I have purchased and thought it would be easier than using my current 20 ft. long leash that gets tangled and dirty dragging behind my dog.  I assumed (and one should never assume) the leash was a nylon flat belt style but it is a cord, I did not see any specs that would have described the actual leash.  Although I will use it I am a bit skeptical about the strength, I bought the Large for dogs up to 110 lbs.  My dog is just under 70 lbs. but likes to pull so I will update this after I have some experience with it.<br /><br />The package was open inside the envelope when it arrived and there were no instructions on how to lock or unlock the brake, just trial and error until you figure it out.  It doesn't appear to be a used item but since the blister package was open and apparently taped closed I wonder if it was a return.  The unit has the brand name &#34;Amazing Dog Leash&#34; and a disclaimer label that states &#34;NEVER allow the cord/tape to become wrapped around fingers, hands, arms, legs, etc  The cord/tape can cut or burn you or another person&#34;  No other markings on the unit, no indication of the size and since the package was open I just hope what I received is the Large for 110 lb. dogs.  Other brands for large (over 100 lb.) dogs seem to all have a tape style leash that would appear stronger than the cord and since the disclaimer clearly states &#34;cord/tape&#34; one can only assume (there's that word again) that some models of the brand &#34;Amazing Dog Leash&#34; have the tape.",3.0,Pet_Supplies,0,26

"As good as OEM at 1/4 the price: I waited on Blue Nook to have the Wasabi batteries for the RX100 because I really enjoyed the version they had for E-PM1. Since I was hit with a bit of ""brand loyalty"" i jumped on these as soon as they were out!<br /><br />I can't give scientific or exact info on the batteries, but I do know they seem to last as long as the OEM batteries. With the OEM batteries I shot ~200 shots per day and would get down to 1/2 capacity. These Wasabi batteries seem to mimic the life of the originals. Couple that with the option to externally charge them and you have a winner. Sadly I can't say how long each took to recharge since I'd either charge overnight or run off and do other errands. The car adapter is a plus for those times may need an emergency boost. But right now 1 OEM plus 2 of these will last me longer than I need.<br /><br />I hope they make batteries for my next camera! It may not be for a few years though, lol.<br /><br />Maybe when I have some spare time I'll try and do a charge/discharge test. I generally don't let my batteries go below 1/2 as going under 40% could lessen the life - according to what the internets told me ;).",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"I love this printer!: I ask my wife frequently, &#34;Have I mentioned lately that I love this printer?&#34;<br /><br />I had an HP Somedangthingorother previously that irritated the heck out of my with its inability to do much of anything easily except for print text from our main computer.<br /><br />I bought this hoping for some sort of improvement. Imagine my joy when it does everything it is supposed to do with a great amount of ease! It prints! Quickly! From any of our computers / devices wirelessly! Without losing the connections to said devices!<br /><br />That in itself is fantastic, but it does so much more. I can scan with it, easily. Heck, I can even use the ADF to scan stuff in and it somehow manages to scan in both sides of a paper if asked to do so. I was dubious the first time I went to try it and it worked flawlessly. There are features I haven't even tried yet that I bet work wonderfully, like the card reader...and I haven't tried to print on odd-sized paper, but from everything I've seen so far, I'd be willing to bet it will work just as well. Oh, and while I don't print a ton of things in color, I have not yet changed either of the inks from the ones they sent with the printer.<br /><br />If I had one negative thing to say, it's a software issue. I have been scanning in my old photo albums and saving them offsite with a backup service and it's a bit annoying to have to suffix every scan with 001, 002, etc. Sometimes that can be handy, but the ability to turn off the automatic numbering would be a nice feature. Mom's cake recipe001.pdf is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyways, if I could give this thing six stars, I would. Kudos, Epson, I'll certainly look to you for any future printers.",5.0,Office_Products,1,24

It‚Äôs an orange yellow and not at all what I wanted. Still, I was really excited to have a metal camelbak because I like straw water bottles and the ability to keep water cold without condensation. However, even after taking care to follow the wash instructions (I even hand washed everything), the bottle was leaking upon first use. Usually in the past I could drop my camelbak a few times before it started to leak out of the mouth piece but this did it right away.

I purchased it for use in a commercial retail business and it has not held up as I expected it would, the biggest issue is that it works intermittently, which is a real problem when someone needs hand soap.",2.0,Industrial_and_Scientific,0,19

The lenses fogged up the first time I put them on (albeit I live in humid Texas) and although they are yellow they do NOT help at night (many yellow lensed glasses/goggles do).

"Nice bottle, but the spout comes loose too often: This water bottle features solid aluminum construction and come in really fun patterns and colors. I bought this thinking that it would have fewer parts to break than Contigo's other water bottles for kids. So far it is holding up better than the Striker or Autospout bottles, however the drinking spout is a separate piece and frequently comes unscrewed. The drinking spout is a dishwasher-safe plastic part that screws onto the bottle, and which the lid screws into. Unfortunately when my child unscrews the lid to take a drink, she often unscrews the drinking spout as well. It seems that now matter how tightly I put it together in the morning, when she comes home from school the spout is attached to the lid and not to the bottle.  Also note, that the bottle is not dishwasher safe.<br /><br />Overall it's a nice bottle and has lasted longer than our plastic Contigo bottles, the spout and washing instructions are the only drawback so far.",3.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,0,28

"I LOVE MY TENT!: I'm very impressed with this tent, I had originally bought it from Backcountry Edge for $125 and now the price has dropped on Amazon to $80, total steal!!! I have gone on two camping trips to Acadia, Maine and now on my way to Sacandaga Lake, NY. On my 2nd trip to Acadia we (3 people in the tent) experienced a rain storm, pouring rain, lightning and thunder...the works. There wasn't a drop of rain inside my tent and the 2 vestibules kept our shoes and other items dry.<br /><br />It's sturdy, spacious, very easy to set up (15-20 min) and if you ask me...a pretty good looking tent! The detail of 2 doors is super great, no need to climb over anyone.<br /><br />Helpful Tip: I wasn't crazy about the smooth metal stakes that it came with so I bought additional stakes (Coghlan's ABS Tent Peg) for under $1.00 each and used those for the actual tent. I used the Slumberjack standard stakes for the rainfly/vestibule and ventilation ties.<br /><br />As long as you secure the tent and rainfly properly (including the side-release buckle ties) you should not have any issue with ventilation at all. The tent stays dry through the heat, cold and rain.<br /><br />Sadly, the gear loft and footprint are sold separately but it's also worth the buy!<br /><br />Interesting Find: In my research, before buying this product, I found out that ""Slumberjack is a division of American Recreation Products (ARP), St. Louis, which owns a variety of high-performance outdoor brands, including Kelty¬Æ, Sierra Designs¬Æ and Royal Robbins¬Æ"", Kelty sit/news.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004Y6MJIC Slumberjack Trail Tent Footprint]]",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Waste of Money: I bought this product so I could charge my Galaxy S10+ and my watch Samsung Galaxy 44mm watch at the same time.  I can't use it for my watch because the watch gets so hot that you can barely touch it to take it off.  The watch even shows a warning display after only a few minutes of being on the charger.  As for the phone, it charges it but it's as slow as molasses to charge AND the ENTIRE time it's on the charger it CONSTANTLY disconnects and reconnects (with and without the case on it) and is CONSTANTLY beeping because of the connection going in and out .  I ended up removing the cord and just plugging my phone into my computer and it charges the right way very quickly.  I don't even use the dock anymore.  This was definitely a WASTE of almost $50.  I DO NOT recommend this product.  I do have to say though that when I first got it and I complained about the charger heating my watch, the seller was very quick to respond and try to solve the problem but there is no way to solve this problem without just giving the charger back and getting a refund but, they don't do returns and refunds so this was, without a doubt, LITERALLY a waste of money.",2.0,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0,9

"What was the underlying true motivation for writing this book?: Nicholas Wade is not a scientist, neither an efficient reader of data, let alone history. To advance that African- Americans are more violent than White Folks, with a reference to Jewische people as most obsessed with capitalism and more of such nonsense, all derived from, or based on a genome is a display of sublime ignorance. Is there a possibility Mr Wade may learn about the 2014 years of the Holy Roman Empire which continues to shape the world we are forced to live in? Capitalism is this institution Summum Bonum/highest good, unfortunately not a la Cicero, with Child Abuse sold as education for more than a century as its latest achievement; its obsession with indoctrination as education without substance. There is no greater criminal institution where no laws appear applicable, to those who hold the power with very little melanin in the skin: has Mr Wade any genome explanation for the cruelty from the Vatican?

"Sweet love story: The first thing that I want to say is, there isn't any get my straight friend drunk and rape him in this story. I saw what another reviewer wrote and I have to admit if I had seen the review I wouldn't have read the story cause that isn't my thing. However, I can see how this reviewer got confused because they didn't read the story.<br />At the very beginning there is a part that talks about a gay man sitting across from his straight friend who is only in a blanket cause he showed up in the rain. The straight friend is drinking alcohol and confessing his life story but the gay friend isn't paying attention because all he can think about is getting the straight friend to bend over for him.<br />What this is, is a story prompt. Fans send a scenario to an author and the author writes a story around it. There is even a photo prompt. The problem is right after the story prompt, the blurb for the book starts, and directly after that the book starts. There isn't enough spacing between all of that and I had to reread it a couple of times to figure out exactly where the story begins.<br />I don't want to say much about the story because it's short and I don't want to give anything away cause I hate when other reviewers do that.<br />I will say it was well written and there were sweet moments and passionate moments. It was well written and believable. I can say that often times stories are a little unreal and that's ok because sometimes that is why we read them. We need to suspend belief and believe the impossible, like Disney fairytales instead of the brothers Grimm.<br />However, these characters are very realistic and you can see the events in a that could probably happen way.<br />It's a free read as I am reading this, so go ahead and read it<br /> I will be looking for more of this author's work.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

This is not twilight""  I swear I laughed until I cried!<br /><br />now the sexy scenes were amazingly tasteful and very erotic....Masi was extremely gorgeous and very well packaged! yummy! Lex was smart mouthed even foul mouthed....but wonderfully refreshing! the ""girls"" (including Blake) were true defitntion of best friends! I cannot say enough how much I loved this book and Unscrupulous! I CANT wait to read more from Ms. Aster and believe you me I WILL BE!!! 5 wonderfully super sexy Italian stars!!! xoxo",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Total junk compared to previous model: I had the SB220 for over 4 years before the left speaker just recently shorted out. Other than that, I thought they were excellent headphones given the price point. They had very decent sound and were very comfortable to wear.<br /><br />That being said, I figured I was safe in giving the SB221 a shot. They are definitely not an improvement. First of all, they are not nearly as comfortable. They fit tighter than the 220 did and the ear cushions are not as soft.  Those are things I could live with however as long as they sound decent.  While the overall sound quality is comparable to the 220, the Bluetooth connection is absolutely terrible. Every time I try using these, my connection is completely filled with glitches. Sound is constantly cutting in and out. I‚Äôm using this on an iPhone SE & iPad from a few years ago, and it‚Äôs having issues staying connected to both devices. I‚Äôve updated the software & powered the devices off & on several times, but nothing seems to correct this issue.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I already threw the package away & am outside my return window.  Otherwise I‚Äôd be sending this piece of garbage back. I saw another reviewer said this was a hit or miss item.  I definitely may have just gotten a defective product. However, I‚Äôm not taking the of ordering another set of this brand. I‚Äôd personally recommend spending more money on a more reputable brand and higher quality set of headphones.",1.0,Electronics,0,12

Great unless you need to program your ECU (Subaru): Works great but does not work to get the car to recognize OEM sensors in Subarus or cars that require the ECU to be programmed.

"Horrifying: This is the scariest movie I think I have ever seen.  It started off kinda lame, but that was part of what lulled you into watching it not expecting what was coming next.  The fact that it was based on a true story and that at the end during the credits it shows the people involved made it scarier even though the movie was over.  If you love horror/thriller type movies, this will freak you smooth out.  The blood and gore was kept to a minimum, the movie didn't need that to be horrifying.  I watched it alone and in the dark, because that's how I like to watch scary movies.  Big mistake.  LOL.  I recommend this highly, but I won't be watching it again.  That's how scary it is.  Don't let any kids see this, even though there's no nudity or much blood, it will terrify them.  Use your own judgement, but I would never let kids under about 16 see it.  I literally prayed after it was over as if I had let evil into my house.  I don't remember a movie that made me feel like that.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22
Another Example of Trying to Make Things as Cheap As Possible Rather Than Focusing On Quality: Cheap and flimsy.  I only go out and have to carry my wallet about once a week.  I'm very careful in how I handle my wallet.  After about 5 weeks - a mere handful of uses - the very first page of windows started to separate from the rest.  The tear was more than halfway down the seam.  Luckily I caught it in time or I might have lost those four cards.<br /><br />These were a complete waste of money.  I don't trust that the other pages won't tear as well.<br /><br />I'll have to keep searching for the Rolfs windows.  Those were quality and lasted for years.  But they're hard to find.,1.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0,10
"Greener than expected but decent for the price: So I'm not sure why, but this leash photographs like it's a teal/aqua color in both the sales photos and my own, but in person it's closer too a gumby green. I don't know what these sellers are smoking but this leash is NOT 2.5mm thick. Its 1mm(I measured it) and feels the same as the cheap leashes you can get from the dollar store. The design is super cool, the handles are comfortable and soft, and it seems well sewn together, but the main material feels cheap. It'll get the job done but feels like it wont last a long time. But that's what you get at this price range. I'd recommend this for a small dog or senior dog that doesnt chew because a hard puller would make this snap and a chewier would get through it in seconds. It's cheap, so you could maybe use it for training a puppy and expect it to get chewed to pieces while its teething, then replace it with a better quality one later on.",3.0,Unknown,0,32
Great product! Switching over from lakonta: Great flavor.. I actually use it in all my baking now so I don't have to worry about biting into sugar granules in some recipes.

"Phil Dick Revisited: This strong first novel follows two paths.  On the one hand our narrator has perceptions of the world that are strange and mystical.  He wonder's if Richard S. Shaver -- who wrote about evil underground dwellers callefd the &#34;dero&#34; that &#34;tampered&#34; with mankind was right.  The other thread is the storyof a young  man in the 70s coming of age and overcoming mental illness.  But neither path is the Truth.  Truth comes from synthesis -- of Wonder and the day job, of Terror and home maintence.  This book provides hope and Horror, Wonder and responsibility with a good dose of humor and a healthy disrespect for authority.  Besides it includes a diagramfor making a &#34;cootie catcher.&#34;  This is a happy, tender version of themes that Phillip k. Dick obsessed with.  A good book from a writer to watch -- I reviewed in more detail in the _Nw York R3eview of Scince fiction._",5.0,Books,1,7

"Old school perfection.: My mother is old school....literally and figuratively. She is in her late 60s and not necessarily interested in keeping up with things via modern technology. One thing that she asked for for Christmas was a new address book. Of course I tried to explain how she could keep her contacts on her computer or on her cell phone, but she was insistent, she wanted an old fashioned address book. I found this one on Amazon and she loves it. I even decided to get one for myself. I purchased the &#34;Making Connections&#34; version for her and the &#34;Celestial&#34; one for me. Making Connections is black with embellishments and the Celestial is a nice shade of blue with gold embellishments. The pages are the perfect size and easy to write on with ink or pencil.

And this is America- so it's all about what's on the outside.: It's October and I was on the market for a new cell phone case for my 'new' phone. I loved the fact that my phone was gold so I wanted a case to reflect this.<br /><br />This pink color is super smooth for summer and spring- ideally I would have wanted this coral to be a beautiful burgundy like they sell in the Note 7 size. But not all of us are a Kardashian so we don't always get what we want right?<br /><br />I enjoy that this case is slim compared to other cases. Haven't gone and dropped my phone to test to see how great it works. (I have a 2 year old so give it another 2 months and she will have tested the strength). I thought the back with the grips would be ideal- and they are. Kind of. Things seem to get trapped in there? Mainly dirt? I work a cushy office job and still sing the ABCs twice when I was my hands so it's not that I'm a dirty person but there are distinct marks from fingers on this thing.<br /><br />But it's still pretty.

I'm giving it four starts only because it didn't come with any direction on how to care for it. But it does work well and it protects me when I'm out on the field, especially when I'm crawling around. I use to get tons of scratches and splinters on my arms but this helped prevent those from happening again.",4.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"Two of these for home-office is great!: Recently upgraded from a 10-year old flatscreen and a hand-me down to 2x of these.<br /><br />I am not sure if it is the blue-light filter, the better refresh rate, adaptive sync or simply the larger screen, but I don't have headaches after work anymore.  IN fact, I can continue working at night on other projects without any issue.  Love these monitors!<br /><br />I did want to get a 4k, but to get eye-care and 75hz refresh rate, I'd be shelling out 600+ bucks PER monitor if I went with 4k.<br /><br />These are a heck of a deal.

"Like having a conversation with a compassionate but foul-mouthed friend over drinks: I wish I‚Äôd had this book when I was younger. Tara Schuster recounts how losing her job during the pandemic triggered past trauma that she thought she had already healed. She then shares how she engaged in deeper healing through methods such as therapy, slowing down and getting to know herself better, exploring spirituality, learning to be with her emotions, and setting boundaries. Part memoir and part self-help, this is a sequel to her previous memoir (which I highly recommend), but it stands on its own.<br /><br />Tara swears a lot and uses slang and abbreviations that might confuse or turn off some readers, and her stories sometimes ramble so much they are hard to follow, but I appreciate her authenticity and unique voice. She shares her story with incredible honesty and vulnerability as well as humor and compassion for both herself and others. Reading this book feels like having a conversation with a compassionate but foul-mouthed friend over a few too many drinks.<br /><br />Each chapter includes a suggested healing technique or tips and often resources for further information. I found many of Tara‚Äôs suggestions familiar, but I picked up a few new tips, and repeated exposure to these ideas can be helpful. As someone who often gets bogged down trying to make decisions, I particularly loved Tara‚Äôs tips for reconnecting with your essential self, finding your deepest desires, and conjuring Future You.<br /><br />I think this book could be helpful for many people who are suffering from trauma or mood disorders or just feel unhappy with their current life. Avoid if you dislike swearing, frank discussion of sex and drug use, or books that blend memoir with self-help.<br /><br />I was provided an unproofed ARC through NetGalley that I volunteered to review.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Not What You Would Expect,  Especially by the Pictures Shown by Seller: I was initially looking for a journal to use for a Bullet Journal.  This journal type came up as a good idea for people who are left handers so we do not have to fight the spine of normal journals with our hand.  From the picture that the seller provides it looks like a normal black Journalist Type Journal that is very similar to a basic Moleskine or one of the Amazon journals.  I was disappointed upon first arrival as the cover as different than the image that is attached by the seller.  The second disappointment was the fact that the interior of the journal is dated which is very annoying and honestly quite a turn off point for me.  The back pocket was a nice surprise, but I do have to say that overall the entire journal is not that great.  I posted decent pictures so people can see what they are actually buying.

"EMOTIONAL & HEARTFELT JOURNEY: Georgia, 1968 ‚Äì Margaret Rose McCutcheon has just buried her husband and must now name a beneficiary for their estate in case of her demise. She is hard-pressed to do so because there is no one. No children. No family. At least none to speak of. At one time, she had two sisters and six brothers, but the lot of them were scattered to the four winds, with no one knowing where the others went. In the hope of finding at least one of her siblings, Margaret hires a detective and sets off on a journey to uncover the truth of why the family broke apart as it did.<br /><br />  West Virginia, 1901 ‚Äì When Eliza Hobbs gives birth to her sixth child, her husband is not there to welcome his daughter into the world. No surprise, because Martin is seldom there. He works in Charleston and returns to Coal Creek only when he has a mind to. Yes, he sends money on occasion, but seldom enough to make ends meet. Although Eliza believes each new child a blessing, he sees them as yet another responsibility on his already overloaded shoulders. When he discovers another child is on the way, he demands she get rid of it. he stops returning home and there is no more money.<br /><br />  Left with the children, a mountainside patch of land, and a house in sorry need of repair, Eliza seeks help and turns to someone powerful enough to hold sway over Martin and force him into providing for his family. Pushed to the brink, Martin does something unforgivable and the family is forever torn apart.<br /><br />  Now, after all these years, will Margaret be the one to find the pieces of her broken family?<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />When I Last Saw You begins with Margaret dealing with the loss of her husband, which includes going through paperwork and discovering interesting details of what her husband had tried to do for her. Curious about why he didn‚Äôt pursue the investigation he had started, she reaches out to the last investigator, Tom Bateman. He wasn‚Äôt that interested in pursuing the case, but when they met up, she was able to persuade him to try.<br /><br />From that point on, we follow Margaret and Tom as they pursue the trail of clues leading them to possibilities they had never imagined. Would Margaret find her family? Would the connection that has developed between her and Tom turn into something more than the working relationship?<br /><br />The story had sad and heartfelt moments, and I laughed, cried, and held my breath as I waited to see what would finally happen.<br /><br />I loved this book, so of course it earned 5 stars.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Higher Volume of Flame: Most of the propane torches available for plumbing and home use are &#34;pencil flame&#34; types - Which means the flame is less than a half inch in diameter. This is fine for most home plumbing repairs and soldering. However, for bending glass tubes (especially Pyrex glass) you need a bigger flame to heat the section you are going to bend.<br /><br />This torch has a larger diameter flame, about 3/4 of an inch in diameter. While the flame itself from this torch is not hotter than the pencil flame type torches - It puts out a bigger flame and more net heat. This comes in handy if you have somewhat larger item to heat or solder. While a quarter of an inch larger diameter may not sound that much bigger - the cross section area is a bit more than twice as much as the pencil torch flame.<br /><br />The torch is MADE IN THE USA and I am pleased with he quality and cost. The torch does not have it's own built-in piezo lighter - but you can buy a grill type lighter or a sparker for about $3.

"feels like a plastic bag: I know its vinyl, and I'm sure that it would protect the mattress from liquid just fine, but I don't care for it. This is just my opinion, but it feels (and sounds) like you're laying on one of those cheap plastic covered mattresses in cabins or possibly jail. I'm not returning it, because it will still serve its purpose, and I can kind of get around the negative part. I had to put a peice of foam on top of it, but under the sheet, in order for it to be bearable to lay on. I can still hear the plastic sound, but not near as much, and I don't feel the stiffness of the vinyl under the sheet. So if you want something to protect from liquids that zips up, this one should do the trick (specially for the price), but you may need to put some kind of egg crate or other foam layer on top of it for comfort.

"Great transition from sleeping in arms only to bed-side cosleeper: Our little one was a baby who couldn't sleep outside of our arms or in a more upright position (bouncer, car seat). He also seemed distressed when I tried to put him to sleep in our bed-side Arms Reach cosleeper. I assumed that it felt huge and wide-open to him after the safety of our arms. I was concerned that he was not able to sleep flat on his back, and I was afraid I'd never get any sleep, so I got this cosleeper to try to transition him to sleeping alone and flat. It worked like a charm!<br />The mattress/pad in this cosleeper ‚Äãis light weight, so I got creative: my little one falls asleep while nursing, so I put the cosleeper mattress on top of my Boppy nursing pillow while my son ate (I made sure he was basically on his back while feeding). When he fell asleep, I carefully transferred him, cosleeper mattress and all, to the cosleeper frame, ensuring he was on his back. (I kept the frame right next to me while nursing.)  After a few days of this, I was able to transfer him without using the mattress. I would swaddle him to make sure he didn't wake from the Moro reflex.<br />The SwaddleMe cosleeper was used inside of our Arms Reach bed-side co sleeper, so when I felt like my son was outgrowing the SwaddleMe cosleeper, I easily transitioned him into the Arms Reach. Once again, I got creative and removed the little mattress from the frame and put baby on the mattress inside the bed-side cosleeper, because he was used to that softness/feeling of the SwaddleMe mattress pad. He slept like that for two nights, then transitioned‚Äãto the big &#34;wide-open&#34; feeling Arms Reach bed-side cosleeper.<br />I used this product a little unconventionally, but it worked!<br />I also folded it down and used as a travel bassinet when visiting friends.

"The Return of the Political: This is a compelling, if not always entirely convincing book.  Clearly Timothy Brennan has faced a few too many smug graduate students, spouting terms like 'hybridity' and 'difference'to prove their radical bona fides, across the seminar table.  Any one whose been in the social sciences or humanities over the last twenty years probably recognizes the type.  His argument is basically that between the anti-state rhetoric  dominant among this type and the relentlessly identitarian politics they practice, there is little room to talk about political programs, electoral coalitions, and other actual mechanics of political change.  They instead practice a politics of individualized performance, in which the ferocity of one's denunciations of 'hegemonic', 'western' culture, etc. epitomize ones commitments.  He claims this neatly dovetails with the American right, and the wider culture of American liberalism, both of which are also anti-state.  He works through this point in well-researched essays on a variety of figures including Salmon Rushdie, Eric Lott, Hardt and Negri, and Antonio Gramsci.  Although I am predisposed to be a little skeptical of Marxists heatedly denouncing postmodernists, all of the essays are rich enough in the details to overcome the sense that this is more old left whining.  What I found a little less than convincing is Brennan's mapping of performative politics onto the political right, as opposed to programmatic politics which open things up to the left.  Okay, today's 'academic left' is self-indulgent and pseudo radical, true enough.  But this distinction has broader purchase beyond academia. Many of the important political movements of the sixties--from MLK's 'beloved community' to the Weather Underground--had a strong element of performativity, of existentially trying to take a stand and live authentically rather than simply attempt to move a political program forward.  The practice continues up to the present in, for example, the Zapatistas.  Anti-statist notions do have some historical content with the disillusionment with bureaucratic leftist projects.  I don't think these issues will fade any time soon.  And notwithstanding that Brennan hits a number of targets hard, I don't think one can dismiss all those crowded around 'theory' as reactionaries.  Stanley Aronowitz, for example, has had a history of political engagement in the more conventional sense.  Despite these reservations, this book should definitely be read and grappled with.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Not Sure it's Even a Three Star: I'm sad to say, Arthur C. Clarke's ""2061 (Space Odyssey Book 3)"" is nowhere near as good as the previous book in the series.  First of all, the first third of the book is almost entirely filler.  Some of it is used for positioning the pieces on the board.  But, for all intents and purposes, it could have been cut entirely from the book.  Second, the crux of the rest of the book is that a spaceship gets stranded somewhere.  It survives its ""landing,"" but can't leave without fuel.  But, unless I'm mis-remembering some of the stuff from the filler third of the book, it's surrounded by the very material it uses for propellant.  Third, the great mystery object that we're supposed to be wondering about is very obviously what it is just as soon as it's mentioned.  Third, I can't come up with any rational reason for anyone to do the things they did that resulted in the stranded spaceship.  And finally, though it's merely a bad frosting on a negative cake, almost the entire last chapter is lifted verbatim from the previous book.  I have no idea what happened to Clarke to cause him to write this book this way.  About the only thing I can say about it that isn't negative is that it isn't actively bad.  So, instead of rating it at the 2-1/2 stars I was thinking about, I'm raising my rating by a half star to a Tolerable 3 stars out of 5.<br /><br />The novels in Arthur C. Clarke's ""Space Odyssey"" series are:<br /><br />1.  [[ASIN:B00ANA27IU 2001: A Space Odyssey]]<br />2.  [[ASIN:B00AHG4DUK 2010 (Space Odyssey)]]<br />3.

"Good, for the office: I really wish Kindles were bigger. Although there are pictures they are not real clear on the Kindle. Maybe the pictures should be full page. The book starts out with doing some regular yoga, mat and all, which didn't really match the idea of doing yoga in the office. Well, unless you have a low key boss anyway. Then it moves to chair yoga. Much more practical. And it has the added advantage that it is going to puzzle the people around you. To me it seems like the book assumes that you have some knowledge of yoga to start with, which if you just happened to pick this up to relieve that back pain at the office you probably don't have.  So the book is helpful, but it needs to have full page pictures and a little bit more basic instruction. If you need to do yoga at the office, you need something at the level of &#34;yoga for dummies&#34; instruction.<br />I want to thank the seller for providing this book for free in exchange for an unbiased review.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Pretty Squishy....: I bought this topper because it was semi-affordable and 3"" which was better than the 2"" maximum that seems more popular. I purchased because of back pain. My current mattress is too hard and my hips dig into it. I did try a 2"" waffle foam topper but it just crushed down to nothing and really didn't offer any cushion so I tried this 3"" topper in addition to the 2"" topper (so 5"" of foam). This stuff is a bit firmer than the super cheap memory foam but it's still way too collapsible to offer much cushion under the heavier parts of your body (ie: your torso). If you want support/cushion for your limbs or just need mild cushion for the rest of you, then this topper will do that trick. I unfortunately can still feel the mattress with my hips once my weight has squished the foam down (and I'm an average sized girl). That's probably more of a personal problem than necessarily a problem with the topper itself tho, I suppose. :)<br /><br />I noticed in some reviews that people complained about the topper moving. I have not noticed any of that. The topper has stayed in place, tho I am careful to avoid dragging myself off the bed which would definitely disturb it. You can also get textured mattress covers for your mattress (anything but slippery silk, honestly) so the topper has enough friction to stay in place. I also use a fitted sheet on top of everything, of course. I have a normal fitted sheet but a deep fitted sheet would work too.<br /><br />Some other reviewers complained about the topper breaking down but I've not noticed that yet and I've been using it since the end of June daily...",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Android Users Beware!!! WORST Customer Service, plus hacking and compatibility problems.: I bought this in June 2019. Device stopped working five months later. When I reported the problem to FitBit, I was told by FitBit Customer Support that my device and account was hacked through FitBit.  I spent days on the phone and in emails working with customer support to get everything reset and reinstalled, but the device would never sync after the hack. I contacted customer service several times and received generally canned and unhelpful device. I called customer service several times and went through the same run through of restarting my phone, uninstalling an reinstalling the app, etc. After two months of the device not working (and merely eight months old), I finally pushed on customer service and refused to hang up without an answer. First, they gave me some ridiculous suggestions - like that I should link the device to someone else's phone! (Why would I want that??) i refused to give in because, at that point, I had wasted hours and hours on this, not to mention the money. Finally, they told me for the first time the device wouldn't work on my version of Android, specifically listing out that every phone I had tried (and failed) to sync the device on post-hacking had ""incongruities."" This is false according to the product ad, which says it is compatible with Android 5.0 and up. I pointed this out, so they tried to set it up on my laptop, which also failed. Only then, only after two months of having a device that got hacked THROUGH FitBit, did they concede to replace it. To add insult to injury, they told me I have to pay shipping to return it. I honestly don't even want the replacement at this point. I've wasted so much time and energy on a defunct watch that doesn't so much as even tell the correct time!<br />In sum, this is product is not secure, is likely incompatible with Android, and customer service is terrible.<br /><br />UPDATE: I returned my unusable, unsyncing watch on February 14, 2020. For over two weeks, I heard crickets. I was supposed to receive my watch after five days, so I started reaching out again. I followed up on the tracking, re-contacted the email sending me the replacement form, and escalated my issue with customer service. Crickets. Eventually, on the 28th (again taking time out of my workday), I called and was placed with a customer service agent who was bewildered about where my replacement had gone, only to discover it was never sent. I received the replacement watch 3 months and 3 days after Fitbit was hacked and it stopped working. Worst part is- it isn't even the watch I bought. It's a bigger, bulkier version that looks just terrible on my tiny wrists. To add insult to injury, they told me to return my charging cable, and the one they replaced it with has no wall plug, which means I'm chained to a computer if I want to charge it. I don't own a home computer.<br /><br />I could not recommend FitBit or their products less. I wish I would have set my money on fire and saved myself the frustration of dealing with this company.",1.0,Electronics,0,12

"For what it is, this is a great little item.: I received the chance to review this item.  It is a pretty nifty little speaker.<br /><br />1. What's in the box?:  You receive the speaker in a box with some instructions.<br /><br />2.  Aesthetic?:  I received the black version of the speaker.  This is essentially a small sized - try about the size of a golfball - speaker with a strap.  It looks nice, but it is so small as to be almost non-existent.<br /><br />3.  Use?:  The first step beyond placing the strap on the speaker, is to turn on the speaker.  This is done by hitting the middle button.  In this way, the speaker becomes discoverable to the phone, tablet or other bluetooth device.  Once the speaker is discovered by the other device, it is ready to go.  Also, this is a speaker that can apparently get wet, but shouldn't be dunked into the water.  The micro USB is slipped into the speaker and is covered by a rubber cover.  Again,  this can be used in a wet environment, but I wouldn't put it on my summer plastic floatie.<br /><br />Sound?:  Frankly, though the physics of the speaker make sense, the small size of this unit really make the sound that comes out pretty impressive.  Is this the beast sounding speaker?  No.  But, for the size, the quality and the depth of the sound is really impressive.  There is no overamped bass, but this is a pretty good balanced sound.  This speaker is sufficient to fill a small room or a outdoor area that is close to the speaker.  The top volume is not blaring, but present and loud enough.  With the strap, you can put this on a backpack or a bike for putting out sound in an easy way. As is typical, bluetooth provided consistent sound from y device to the speaker without any issues.<br /><br />Overall?:  I was quite surprised at the overall power of this speaker.  The sound is good enough, especially at this pricepoint.  If I was to lose the speaker or dunk it, this would not be a despondent time.  The sound is quite good and clear.  However, I wouldn't buy this expecting room filling sound.  I would expect that this SMALL unit will provide easy sound in a small package for places where size and weight matters.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

Then they said they could sell me a refurbish one like the one I had for $164, which just seemed ridiculous. Found this new Dell battery on Amazon, and it is compatible with my specific model. Arrived the next day. Took 5-10 minutes to install, only because I was being super-careful with the tiny screws that hold the laptop cover on (9 screws) and the 4 tinier screws inside the case that hold the battery on to the motherboard.
