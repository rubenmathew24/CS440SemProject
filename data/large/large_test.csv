Exactly what I expected and needed.: This was exactly what I was hoping for. Very well built metal rack. Perfect for my home gym and smaller weights. I use 3lbs up to 20lbs. Very sturdy and solid. Room to add kettlebells if needed. Yes it is small but that’s what I wanted. It took just a few minutes to set up. Self explanatory to do. It does require a wrench to tighten up the bolts which isn’t provided. Otherwise it would be very sloppy just from hand tightening. Highly recommend this if you are looking for a way to store your weights to look clean and organized.,5.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28
"Dark and Tasty: This is a story about David, a young boy who loses his mother to an unnamed illness and seeks comfort in the fairy tales lovingly entwined with her memory. The tales take on a life of their own and David is drawn into a world where good is conflicted and evil is bloody and visceral. Caught on the battlefield of another world, David struggles to find his way back home. The book reminds us of one of the beautiful truths of all fairy tales, that they are stories that belong to storytellers--suited to recreation and retelling in countless ways with innumerable conclusions and possible morals. It's a bit grim for my taste, but elegant nonetheless.  If you dig this kind of thing and don't mind a bit of savagery, go see Pan's Labyrinth (El Laberinto Del Fauno), a Spanish movie in the same strain. Muy bueno, but very dark.",4.0,Books,1,7

"A Romance story you cannot help but love!: Hannah Howell delivers a definitely classic romance story even though it is coming to us for the second time! The re-release of Unconquered keeps you turning the pages with a smile on your face in this historical romance set in 1066 England during the time of William the (Bastard) Conqueror.  Eada, the daughter of Lord Waltheof and Lady Vedette of Pevensey has no idea that life, as she knows it will soon come to an abrupt halt.  Eada, running with her dogs makes her way to visit Old Edith, the friend she treasures most of all, who lives in the secluded hills outside of Pevensey far away from the danger that has just arrived on their shores.  Old Edith, a woman now of advanced years, banished to the hills above Pevensey long ago by the very townspeople who feared the ""sendings"" she would receive and the truth that always came of them.  Old Edith had much to say to Eada this day, of most importance, was the promise she evoked from Eada to heed all they had spoke of, for not only her future but the future of Saxon Pevensey itself, would soon become fatedly entwined with the Norman man who rode with William the Conqueror, their enemy.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Great performances: Clockers is a good 1995 film with great acting and cinematography. It stars Mekhi Phifer in his screen debut with a strong supporting cast including Delroy Lindo, Harvey Keitel, John Turturro, Regina Taylor, Pee Wee Love, and Michael Imperioli. The term ""clockers"" refers to  inner city meth sellers who work around the clock.<br /><br />The film is based on a 1995 novel of the same name  by Richard Price.<br /><br />In a film with so many excellent performances, 21 year old newcomer Mekhi Phifer stands out. He went on to appear in more than 20 films including ""8 Mile"" (2002), ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004), and ""Slow Burn"" (2005). As well, he has been in several TV movies and a regular in series like ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"","" ER"" and ""Lie to Me"".<br /><br />Harvey Keitel is probably one of the finest actors still working. He was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his role in ""Bugsy"" (1991), but the fact is he has sooo many great performances (e.g., ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Mean Streets"" ""Pulp Fiction"",  ""Smoke"" and especially ""Bad Lieutenant""). His performance in this film is one of his better jobs, which is saying a lot.<br /><br />John Turturro is another one of the best actors in the business today. His quirky appearance and physical mannerisms have adorned more than 50 films, the most notable of which include ""Quiz Show"" (1994), ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" (2000), and ""Barton Fink"" (1991). In addition he won an Emmy for his appearance in an episode of ""Monk"" in 2002. Unfortunately we get far too little of Turtorro in this film.<br /><br />The story, per se, is not as complex as you might imagine, but spotty direction by Spike Lee makes it more difficult to follow than it need be. In addition, there are several B and C plots that are left unresolved, which isn't a federal offense, but ...<br /><br />Spike Lee is a well known director of black films that focus on urban problems. His break out film, ""Do The Right Thing"" (1989), was his seventh film and he was Oscar nominated for that film. He also won an Emmy in 2007 for ""When the Levees Broke"". ""Clockers"" was originally slated to be directed by Martin Scorsese, who chose instead to direct ""Casino"".<br /><br />If the direction is less than stellar, the cinematography certainly is not. Malik Hassan Sayeed does a great job in his filming debut. He's continued to work with director Spike Lee (""He Got Game"", ""The Original Kings of Comedy"") and has an active career in TV commercials as well.<br /><br />Terrance Blanchard provides an exciting musical score. Blanchard is a 5 time Grammy winner (out of 12 nominations) and scored more than 20 films including ""Jungle Fever"" (1991), ""Summer of Sam"" (1999), and ""Barbershop"" (2002). He scores all of Lee's films.<br /><br />This is a very good film and deserves to be seen. More than almost any other film it provides an excellent insight into the problem of meth/crack and its impact on inner city people.",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"L2P: I love the diaper genie for one reason - it really is the best at containing odors. Yes, when you open the pail to put a dirty diaper in, some of the odor seeps out. But it goes away quickly afterward, and is more manageable than emptying a trash bin every time you have to throw out a poopy diaper. Which uh, leaves an odor behind either way. Some reviewers are complaining about having to shove the diaper through the top, which yes - you do. But if you're like me, you fold the diapers in such a way that all of the poo and pee is contained within a dirty diaper you've sealed up with the diaper closures (which stick regardless of how many times you take them on and off). I lay the soiled diaper on the inside of the diaper genie, and any wipes I use to clean up, I put them on the top of the closure. Once I'm done using wipes, I use the sealed diaper to push everything through. Therefore, no contact is made with poopy wipes, because they are sitting BELOW the diaper itself. Sometimes there is a mess, buuuut you just shove it down and the diaper genie pulls a fresh area of plastic bag anyway, so what's the trouble? You're not coming in contact with a bag that might have poo on it - that part has been pushed down already. Also, WASH YOUR HANDS?! Anyway, it took some finagling, but once I got the system down I find this pail to be such a convenience. The only negative review I have is how expensive the refills are. I mean, seriously? Come on, Playtex. That is totally sucky. I have yet to purchase the generic brand refills (Target carries them, for example), but I'm probably going to try them soon.",4.0,Baby_Products,1,5

"Quality content for a novice game writer: I'm new to narrative design for games. I'm a software developer and haven't ever written anything long form, so I did some research and happened upon seeing this book was coming out soon. I picked it up because I've heard great things about Mutazione (I'm still early on it). The book was helpful, though many of the techniques, thoughts processes, and tips I had gotten elsewhere online already. I think the many practices she suggests would help quite a bit, but have yet to do them.<br /><br />When I picked up the book, I figured I would skim around, but ended up reading the entire thing front to back. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to pivot into game writing, but can't speak how helpful it would be to a seasoned writer. It does focus on game writing as a career though, rather than writing being a tool in the reader's repertoire as a game designer.<br /><br />One of my issues with the book was the regular mention of cis, hetereosexual, white males. It almost became a mantra in the book. I understand this is an important issue to address, as I assume the industry is still largely dominated by that cohort which could present real challenges for the reader. But the repetitive mentioning of it felt pejorative and alienating.<br /><br />Finally, I felt the book was overpriced. I did miss there was a coupon for the preorder which made it more affordable. But the paperback feels rather cheap, as you can see from the delamination of the cover after light usage over a couple months. You're definitely paying for the author's time/expertise and not for the product.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"Fun and sexy new story in the Fever Falls series!: I really looked forward to reading Sawyer's story, he was a really good side character that I was curious about in the other books. Carter is a very fun loving almost careless guy, yet this book revealed his inner depths and I felt he and Sawyer meshed really well together. Carter is full of sass and confidence, giving Sawyer exactly what he needs to become more secure in himself and like himself more. He was a character I could identify with a lot.<br /><br />Riley and Devon work well as co-authors, and if you liked the Metropolis books you will definitely like this one. Full of humor, sassy and smoking hot, the crew is as rambunctious and wacky as ever and I was loving every second  of it.<br />A definite feel good book that will leave you smiling.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"wonderful french-canadian folk/pop: Durand's ""Diaporama"" is easily her best album, and one of the best francophone folk-pop CDs I have ever heard. Although there are two songs in English, non-French speakers will be missing out on a lot as the lyrics are excellent. ""Diaporama"" is far more acoustic than her previous self-titled album, and focuses on introspective, thoughtful songs about life, love and relationships from a mature perspective.",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

If I lost out on any sleep ...: This is a book that kept calling to me, especially when I was away, and found difficult to put down when I was not. With a full-time job, a full graduate class load and an internship, I often don't get as much time to read what I'd prefer during the semester, but this book kept forcing me to find the time in the best way. If I lost out on any sleep in my consumption, i gave it up all too happily to continually come back to Richard and Bogdan. Even now, as it lays complete in my lap, I feel sorry that I don't have more time to spend with these new friends I've made over the last two weeks. That's not to say that the ending is lacking-on the contrary, I found it to be right on key-but I wish there was simply more to read. I suppose I do know what to say, after all, and to put it simply, this is a book I will come back to again, because like a good friend, I know I won't be able to stay away for long.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Fantastic: I received the juicer few days ago and I am very pleased with the product.

"I want to see more: What would happen if we got a glimpse of the afterlife? In this story, “Discovery of the afterlife had had irreparable consequences, so the Coalition abolished the notion of gods, fate, and prayer, worldwide.” Liz Kerin gives us a fresh take on what the world may look like if we saw beyond our realm in her book The Phantom Forest. Kerin intertwines her version of the afterlife and a fantastical twist on the modern day in such a way that captivates you and forces you to keep reading.<br />We follow Seycia, her brother Miko, and the demon Haben on their separate but entwined journeys for freedom and justice. Miko leads a revolution to overthrow the corrupt powers controlling the world, while Seycia learns how to navigate the underworld and destroy her own demons as well. Haben is a messenger between worlds bestowed with a sick punishment by the devil-like figure Dohv. Haben is tasked with consuming the flesh of sacrifices made in the living world, regardless of age. In the passage where we meet Haben we see him after the sacrifice of a young boy, “He cried as he gorged himself on the entrails, choking back sobs as he swallowed mouthful after mouthful. There was nothing lower than this. This— this was hell.” He fills his belly with the flesh of the sacrifice and starves the rest of the time. But, this is not the only dark secret he possesses, his destructive past is the key to the present. He joins Seycia on her quest to avenge not only herself but her parents.<br />On occasion, Haben’s character loses some of the tortured mentality and seems not to suffer as much as originally let on. I found that bothersome in a few ways, the first being that he doesn’t behave like someone who is constantly starving, secondly his pain seems downplayed, and lastly, this characteristic mostly disappears in the second half of the book.<br />Through The Phantom Forest, we see how changes in the afterlife have an impact on the world of the living, altering people’s fates and the outcome of a revolution. My only critique on this is that I wish I could have seen more. We see Seycia’s decisions change the trajectory of Miko, they flow together beautifully and I would have loved to see this expand. The author is the strongest when she is tangling and untangling the two storylines, her ability to connect character arcs left me satisfied.<br />At first, I had a hard time connecting to Miko. I didn’t see his relevance to the plot until later in the book. I kept asking myself, why is this character important? This question was eventually made clear, but I would have liked to felt a connection to him earlier in the book so that he was a well-rounded character.<br />Kerin does imagery very well, she will paint fantastic settings in your mind. I could see so much color and life in her story that it was hard to put down, I wanted to see where we would end up next. She creates her own lore that isn’t overpowering or hard to keep straight and puts you at the center of her beautiful world. The plot is easy to follow, unlike a lot of fantasy stories, you will not veer off in a thousand different directions. Overall the story is enjoyable and you will fall in love with Seycia’s all or nothing attitude and Haben’s heart wrenching back story.<br />This story is a fresh take on how government and religion clash. Kerin creates this world that seems like it’s going to be your typical fantasy style novel and it turns out to be something entirely different. It tackles the problems that arise when a government decides to eradicate religion, we see how it affects the people, and how it can change entire societal structures. One glimpse of the afterlife leads to war, poverty, and the destruction of history. This all plays out in this twisting tale of adventure, redemption, and vengeance.",4.0,Books,1,7

"23 years of fun and still going!: This toy has gone through  a few colour and character changes, but is still basically the same as it was over 23 years ago when our twins enjoyed it as babies. They had the 1988 version with Sesame Street characters, absolutely loved it, and it provided MONTHS of fun, giggles, and motor skill development. At first they were too young to operate all 5 popups, and it was gratifying to see them learn to master all of them as time went on.<br /><br />Another reviewer gave only 3 stars because her child throws it and dents her floors. IMHO this is an unfair review against the toy which is being used in a manner OTHER than it's intended activity.<br /><br />The best praise I can give is that I packed it away all those years ago, and just recently gave it to our 11 mo. old  grandson, who LOVES it!  How's THAT for an enduring toy?  NO BATTERIES REQUIRED and no annoying music.  I don't think parents can ask for much more.<br /><br />(as an aside, you can easily find it for a much lower price point than $23.48!

"Not quite top of the class.: This comes VERY compressed in its package and really needs a good 12 hours at least to completely expand, plus there is a chemical smell so the room should be well-ventilated for 24 hours for this to blow off. After that it is deep and relaxing to lie on, you really sink into it after being in one spot on it for awhile, and it can be a challenge (in a good way) to roll out of that spot onto another. You should add a thick mattress pad on top of the Topper, and then your sheets on top of that. It does expand to almost 4 inches thick, so if your mattress underneath is already thick it will be difficult to get your sheets to fit. I own a different 3 inch topper of gel on a different foam layer (so two layers in one topper) that is a bit more firm (I don;t sink into it so much) and I think I like that better than this one, hence my only 4 star rating.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Tough but cuddly: My dog loves these toys, and this is the second one I've purchased for her.

I love that these don't have a lot of excess stuffing and that the construction is stronger than other plush-type toys. My dog is not destructive, but she does like to tug, so it's important that toys like this can be put through their paces.<br /><br />I will mention that my mom's dog, a small Boston Terrier, was able to tear open a previous version of the toy. She has a thing for squeakers, and she was able to rip open the seam and remove the squeaker in no time at all. However, under more moderate circumstances, these toys hold up well, and I will continue to purchase them for my dog.",5.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26

One thing that drove me crazy was I like to know how long a chapter is or how many chapters in a book - using the ""Go To"" feature of the Kindle. But only how long until the end of the book was in use. The coincidences are a bit hard to swallow but each starts off its own chain of events. The financial network is in chaos so James couldn't get gas with his debit card which necessitated him going back to the office to get cash which triggered him checking his bank balance and found out it had been drained - and then the fun begins.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20
"Great love story, just desperately lacking in action.: This review and more can be seen at GothicMoms.blogspot.com<br /><br />Kristin Miller weaves together a perfect Contemporary Romance.  But that's just it, it is a Contemporary that just happens to have werewolves; werewolves that don't fight, not really anyway, aren't sex craved as most wolves are, they're basically just regular people who happen to get hairy every now and then.<br /><br />Faith and Carter have been the best of friends from the moment she moved in next door.  So its only natural that when he needs a fake bride that she would be the perfect fit.  Its the perfect business arrangement; he gets the bride he needs, she gets her brothers' college tuition and they both get to keep their friendship in tact.  Since she has no real aspirations for him and he has already found and lost his Luminary, everything should go off without so much as a hitch.  Well, fate just may have other plans.<br /><br />This novel is great for Contemporary fans who would like just a dose of the Paranormal world.  For fans of Werewolf books, maybe not so much; no fooling around with multiple partners, not much howling at the moon, and the claws really don't come out.  Pretty good read, just not my cup of blood, I mean tea.  I need action, violence and blood.  Though I will give this one credit, it is a beautiful love story.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"Hollow: Have you ever gone to a tourist trap, thinking “I’m finally going to see this place”, only to get there a find out that there’s really nothing to see? You get there, you look over a guardrail at the place you thought you’d be able to explore and experience, only to find that you can only look at it from a distance, and then there’s nothing else to do but get back in your car and go home.<br />That is the emotional equivalent of reading The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue.<br />I am so very disappointed in this book. I was so stoked about the premise, and I thought it’d be dark and gritty and cool and we’d get a complex plot with a sprinkle of a love story.<br />But, instead, it was a 300 year slog through the endless emotional cycle of regret and loneliness of a 300 year old girl, her emotionally manipulative demon lover, and her clinically depressed, unbearably boring boyfriend. I could not get through it fast enough.<br />This entire book feels like a missed opportunity. Instead of going from beginning to end, letting time and consequence shape this character, we skate over the tiny detail of our Addie’s immortality by jumping back and forth along the timeline. And I know Victoria Schwab loooves jumping timelines. It’s her jam, and that’s fine, when it’s done well and with purpose. In this book, they’re literally spoilers, even going as far as using the phrase, “Later, she will learn...” Oh, good, then there’s no point in telling this story? Great. Glad I’m here. The timeline jumps not only ruin any tension in the story due to their poor timing, they serve as a mere acknowledgement of the passing of time, and gives us a rushed, topical rundown of the historical events the character has lived through that, while they shape the entire foundation of the world Addie lives in, don’t seem to affect her at all.<br />The other problem is Addie. She is a miserable, honestly pretty whiny, weirdly stubborn character from start to finish, and the author really grinds that misery in at every opportunity. It’s hard to follow her around and not be bored with her, “I’m lonely and sad all the time, but I’m also pointlessly stubborn about staying that way” narrative.<br />I could go on, but I’ll just say, I’m disappointed and I wanted it to be better.",2.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"This is an Example of the Future of GPUs.  Small Yet Powerful.: 1. It runs Quiet.<br />2. It runs Cold.<br />3. It runs Beautifully.<br /><br />Beyond my Expectations.  Installation was a breeze, it's small and compact just the way I like GPUs.  I'm so sick and tired of the Giants they've been trying to shove down our throats.  It is so quiet that I can not even tell it is there, though I expect all GPUs to run quiet my past two have and this is no different.  It runs colder than my 660ti which was not as compact like this.  Performance is beyond what I expected from it.  I'm very pleased.  Every game I've tested so far save for Grand Theft Auto V I've been able to run at max settings at 1080p, with around 60fps.  So I'm very very pleased with it's performance.<br /><br />Only technical issue I've come across so far were Video Drivers Stop Responding/Reset issues when playing GTA V.  Switching the settings to DirectX10.1 and Underclocking with Afterburner by -100 on the core fixed all that without a problem since save for &#34;Crashes&#34; but GTA V is still in it's early weeks on PC so random tech issues are expected.  No issues with any other games though so, only a minor inconvenience.  I'm assuming perhaps likely some conflict with 900 series GPUs with GTA V as it seems others with 970 and 980s have been having similar issues.<br /><br />Over all, in conclusion to me Asus' 970 Mini is the &#34;Future.&#34;  Powerful Yet Compact.  I do hope other hardware manufacturers continue down this line and make the same.  My Medium case welcomes this GPU, it's smaller size gives greater room for airflow in the case, while still providing very good performance for what it is.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Intricately woven mystery: Although it's popular to compare this novel to DaVinci Code, that's a cheesy flave-of-the-month cop-out, since the books are so vastly different in scope, plot, characterization, and most of all, mystery.  A more apt comparison may be The Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte, upon which the film The Ninth Gate was based.

It's an exciting read, filled with surprises, and when the final page is turned, ultimately far more satisfying than any pop-culture trash.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Good image, short depth of field: It works well, allowed me to see where the earwax was (resting on the eardrum) that was causing noises in my ear.  It does have a short depth of field so you need to get it just the right distance to keep the view focused.  I'd guess this is common in these small devices.  It was also hard to aim as I moved it around; likely a user with more experience, or a 2nd person operating it, will have no trouble.<br /><br />The wax scooper is very hard for me to use with the above issues. The hook blocked the view esp with the short depth of field; I once found it too near the eardrum by surprise.  I do use simpler wax scoop tools safely and easily by feel.  Ear wax rinse fluid did the trick once the otoscope showed me that wax was the issue.<br /><br />Overall it is just the ticket to see what's in your ear canal.  Saw my eardrum for the 1st time which is was safe for me to do without the scoop attached.",4.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Cortot - not perfect but always fascinating: Cortot treats Chopin's Etudes as music first, and technical matters second.  Indeed, the technical baubles (along with the textual changes) would get Cortot banned from any piano competition today.  But seldom if ever have the Etudes been played with such conviction, such narrative sweep.<br /><br />Cortot was undoubtedly one of the great Schumann interpreters.  In the Symphonic Etudes, Cortot plays the five posthumous Etudes, interspersing them with the standard Etudes in an effective way.  There are numerous remarkable details of phrasing, tempo, and the use of inner voices throughout the performance, along with some scrambling in the more demanding sections.  Each of the little scenes in Carnaval is characterized in a unique way, including the Sphinxes section, which is generally not played.  Cortot digs deep into the mystery of  Schumann's Kreisleriana.  As with Chopin, the printed note was hardly sacrosanct to Cortot, and there are numerous textual emendations that would be frowned on today, including left hand bass extensions.<br /><br />The remastered recordings sound satisfactory.  However, Michael Steinberg's liner notes are irritating.  Filled with uncritical praise of Cortot, knocking Arthur Rubinstein's early Chopin recordings as ""prosaic,"" and glossing over Cortot's involvement as High Commissioner of Fine Arts for the Nazi-collaborationist Vichy regime, they do a disservice to music, historical perspective, and the listener.",4.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

In the league of Rubber Soul and Dark Side of the Moon. The raw emotion of Eric Burden, the wordplay of Al Stewart and the brutal intelligence of John Lennon is the best way I can try to describe how strongly and deeply KG's music strikes a chord in the hearts of his fans. You just can't get it out of your mind, for some people it's so strong, they can't listen to it continuously or even regularly, it's that emotionally wounding to them. Myself, if I haven't heard it in a day or two, I need my fix soon because I keep craving it. Be sure to enjoy all the other material he performed as well.

"What would you do if you found out you had a secret sibling ?: I have always been fascinated with the whole discovering of another family and I wonder if it's stemmed from my own experiences of discovering I had an older half-brother when I was 6-7 years old and then my Dad not knowing his ""real dad"" and the imagining that he might have half-siblings out there. Then when my Grandad passed away we discovered that he had another daughter out there as he was a truck driver and had kept this secret from my Nana and his family for over 60 years. In The Secret Sister, Ella's mother has died and she has discovered a box of things at the back of her wardrobe - in the box is a picture of her mother and a baby named Colleen and a letter from Colleen's father Reagan.  Turns out at the same time, Colleen has just discovered that she was adopted and has another family - she is headed to Sligo, Ireland to search for her father. During this time it has also given Colleen a chance to escape from her life with her possessive husband Jake. We have Colleen in Ireland and Ella in Surrey, London and Ella find Colleen on Facebook, and the pair connect and start chatting. This ends with the pair meeting up in Sligo with Ella's family. Things though don't turn out exactly how Ella imagined as Colleen is bitter and also things aren't adding up in Colleen's stories. Jumping forward Colleen goes missing and Ella being the ""good girl"" decides to hunt her down, however, she ends up being caught up in Colleen's drama and the pair are kidnapped.  However, we are about to discover all is not what it seems, and will Ella ever see her own family again, or will the sisters die in each other's arms?

western themed spanking romance: This wasnt just the story of Val Master who was a high spirited widow and Oliver Herring who was the town sheriff. Val had 3 grown boys and one school aged one. So not only did we get Val and Oliver's story her 3 oldest boys also found their women during the book. Book had suspense elements running through it about a ruthless gang of men that had no problem killing and raping along with plenty of spanking especially of Val who had one heck of a temper but always lost it for a good reason. I enjoyed the first half of the book a little more than the second half but overall if you like western themed spanking romance this was an ok read.,4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Great for Food Prep and More: These are basically strong, plastic-coated rectangular paper plates, but they really do work very well as disposable cutting boards, and they are surprisingly knife-resistant. Although at least one reviewer considered them not green-friendly, the upside of is that you don't have to worry about them becoming a bacterial breeding ground like wooden or plastic cutting boards can be. I have to admit, however, that on occasion I feel a little guilty throwing one out if the board is a little too big for the food prep job. An alternative smaller size would be nice, but then i guess that would make it just another paper plate. As some other reviewers pointed out, these are also great for snack trays or even a light meal. They'll be very handy items in my kitchen.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"Reasonable price, but solid mount.: Nice all around, secure unit. I mounted a 55” TV with no worries. Only issue is that there is no true center. If you center the unit in an opening when extended, it will be off to the side when retracted to the wall due to the “accordion” action...if that makes sense. With that said, align the mount in the opening in the retracted or extended position, whichever position you will use it most often, so that the tv will be centered in that opening on the wall. I centered the mount and my tv in the extended position so now when I retract it to the wall, it’s off to the right of center and it looks goofy.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

This unit starts smoking badly above 4,000 MSL and becomes so rich that it won’t even ignite above 6,000 MSL, it just dumps raw fuel dripping out the exhaust and throws a cascade of error codes. Other all-in-one units appear to be equipped with the 3-wire LCD controller and they may be fine, with the dosing pump correctly programmed for higher altitudes, but this 5KW all-in-one should be avoided above 4,000 feet elevation.",2.0,Automotive,0,4

"Almost there: The Echo 3rd gen is very nice... it most certainly have enough color choices to match my home's various decor.<br /><br />On the functionality front, it is very good as well.  It is still a bit off compared to Google Assistance in terms of some of the voice recognition and answers Alexa can provide but not bad.  The leg up with the Echo is the ring light on it to give passive feedback like a notification or any pending issues.  It would be great if it can be used as a nightlight .  Oh, speaking of notification, I do wish I can see the notification in the Alexa app so I can dismiss it without using my voice to have it read out the notification.<br /><br />And definitely a huge plus for such a small device to integrate with the Ring alarm system to detect glass break and fire/smoke alarm sounds!  I was concerned that Ring doesn't have a glass break sensor but then the home setup tech told me about this feature which is super nice.  It doesn't feel as creepy since the mode is only on when the alarm is armed which is when nobody is home.<br /><br />Oh... the sandstone color looks great!!",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Large, Colorful, Great Scents: This bath bomb set has six large colorful bath bombs, each with a surprise toy inside. The scents are wonderful, and each bomb changes the bath water to a pretty color. The surprises are tiny little cartoon animals that the grandkids absolutely love. They would be a choking hazard for tiny tots, so they are not recommended for children under 3 years old. The ingredients are very basic--plant essential oil, citric acid, sea salt, and baking soda. The scents are Lavender, Rose, Grapefruit, Lemongrass + Lavender, Grape, and Cherry. The design of the box is very kid-friendly, and very giftable as is. As an adult, I also enjoy these bath bombs for kids, because I know the ingredients will be child safe and the colors and scents will be fun. Plus, I get just as big a kick out of watching the little surprise appear when the bomb dissolves as the grandkids do. The current listing price of $19.99 is reasonable for these six large bath bombs and the joy they bring the grandkids.",5.0,Beauty_and_Personal_Care,1,6

"Great Camera Bag: I got this for my gear after trying those NatGeo packs and a few others. It's an awesome bag, but it definitely won't be the best option for everyone.<br /><br />So far it works a lot better than everything else I've tried, and the waterproof/hardcase portion of the pack gives me a little more confidence when I'm taking my gear out for field work. If you want a 'ruggedized' and reasonably lightweight pack, this is probably a good choice.<br /><br />With that said, here's a few problems you might run into-<br /><br />1- This pack doesn't actually hold much despite it's size. A full frame camera, a flash and one or two lenses is about all it'll hold in the camera compartment.<br /><br />2- The hardcase portion doesn't come with much padding. At $170 I'd expect to have more divider portions available. Fortunately I already had foam dividers from the other bags I tried.<br /><br />3-The zippers on the upper portion are kind of a pain to open and close. Not sure how they'd work around that given the thick/stiff material that was used. My priority is protecting my gear so I'm willing to overlook that.<br /><br />4- If you plan on bringing a laptop look elsewhere. There isn't any compartment large enough for that. If you plan on using this as your only bag for travel, you'd better pack light. I'd realistically only be able to fit my camera and a lens or two in the bottom,  and a change or two of clothing on top. Anything else would have to fit in the side pockets, and they don't exactly expand to fit a whole lot.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"I am very impressed with the quality at this modest price: The lenses come boxed with a zippered hard case.  The set includes two phone clips to hold the lenses and three different lenses:  a 198 degree fisheye, a smaller 0.65x wide-angle and the 15x macro lens for very close detailed pictures.  The metal cases and glass lens are high quality and produce clear crisp images.  Full instructions with illustrations are provided that clearly shows how to attach and use the lenses.  When I first opened the item it seemed like there was only two lenses.  But checking the instructions and illustrations you see that the 15x macro lens is screwed together with the 0.65x wide angle lens.  Use them together for the wide angle but using the macro requires you to unscrew them and just use the macro by itself.  Very simple to do with the quality metal cases.<br />The pictures I have provided were taken with a Samsung Galaxy S8 edge.  I pushed the lenses gently onto the clips and then slide it over the phone making a perfect fit.  The assembly is snug to ensured the lens will remain in place but easily slides off when no longer needed.<br />My pictures show the images “with the lens attached” and “without, or the normal image taken by my phone’s camera”.  The macro lens allows pictures as close as 0.4 inches and up to 1.2 inches away.<br />I review many of the products I buy on Amazon. I only rate items 5 stars if I would pay full price for it or be willing to give them as a gift. I do give 1 star (since you can't give 0) to items which are so bad that I throw it away or wouldn't want it even if free.

"Essays I have never forgotten: Had to read these essays in college for an English class and the message within them stay with me still.<br /><br />This is not the insight of American and it's not about American politics or history so there may be very obscure references that you may not know about but they do not cloud the message at all, so worry not. These are essays about, you guessed it, morality and ethics from the perspective of a well-respected intellectual.<br />Don't expect anything more than essays and you'll be fine. A bit of forewarning on my part for anyone looking to buy this.<br /><br />The price is a bit steep at nearly $13 for a book that you can read in one sitting frankly. I wouldn't recommend buying it for the price, you can pick it up used for far cheaper. Mind you, I'm not saying this to cheapen the writing but in this day and age, $13 for a tiny collection of essays is ridiculous.<br /><br />But this is one of those books that you'll always keep around and drag out now and then to give it a quick read, to reflect upon his well-constructed and brilliant arguments about things like compassion, history, and war.

I needed a chair that wasn't &#34;professional&#34;, (in the $500-$600 price range), but was comfortable, able to hold me, and shared features found on more expensive chairs. I worked in offices for thirty five years, and a call center for a decade, so I have sat in many different office chairs.<br />This chair was easy to assemble, and it has served me well for many months. The arm rests are perfect, (although I don't dare put too much weight on them), The padded seat is not too soft, not too hard, just right. The mesh back is cool and allows airflow, and has just the right stiffness when leaning back.<br />I would definitely buy this chair again.",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Excellent iMac Functional Keyboard for Great Price: This keyboard synced quickly and easily with my iMac and as far as I can tell all the keys function as designed.  I don't use many of the designated 'short-cut' keys at the top, but the following 'short-cut' keys do work: volume works for all programs so far, and play/pause, previous track and next track keys work with my Spotify App installed on this computer. Those particular 'short-cut' keys are in the same place as the previous Apple keyboard, just not spaced the same. A simple getting used to it issue. Two other 'short-cut' keys: the screen minimize and magnify (which were not on my Apple keyboard) also work.<br /><br />I do miss the smaller size of the wired Apple keyboard I had, but I'm perfectly happy with this one for 1/2 the price of replacing with another Apple. (see attached pictures) It's actually about the same physical length but it is wider, and the key spacing is very different. As with most keyboard changes (work vs. home, laptops, etc) it'll just take a little use and my fingers will automatically find where they need to be. Someone mentioned the Delete and Home key were reversed on this keyboard (the keys in-between the keypad and the number pad) - and I never use the home key, but the Delete key IS usually on the bottom - with this one it's on the top.  I never thought about the placement until I hit the home key expecting it to delete. Yes, that is seriously the hardest adjustment to make — and not a big deal, but since I saw it mentioned I thought I'd confirm it. And also to that point - the home key does work, since I do still accidentally hit it and then get confused when my curser takes me to the beginning of the page instead of deleting….<br /><br />Unfortunately the keys are not nearly as quiet as the Apple, but they are more quiet and easier to type with (as in needing little pressure to type) than my dell keyboard or my laptop keyboard. I didn't deduct a star for this as this is not an issue for me — IF you are looking for that whisper quiet that comes with the Apple brand keyboard, than I would say this is only a 4 Star keyboard, but hey, it's also 1/2 the price.<br /><br />The two USB ports on the keyboard, on the backside, are very convenient for plugging in my phone to charge and/or connect to my computer. Well worth the few extra dollars over the same keyboard without the USB ports.<br /><br />It's thicker than the Apple, but it is as light if not lighter.  Although it really just sits on my desk. I don't carry it around the house (it's wired) and I don't exercise with it so I'm not sure why people care, but there ya go.<br /><br />Pros: This is a fully functional, nice looking (I got it in white) keyboard that synced perfectly with my Apple iMac in about 5 seconds.  Easy to use, quieter than most keyboards, has 2 very helpful USB ports right on the back of the keyboard (right behind the MACALLY logo on the top right of the keyboard), there is a number lock/caps lock/short cut key light to let you know if those functions are locked on the keyboard, it has 'short-cut' keys I didn't realize were so handy until I got this keyboard and it is 1/2 the price of the wired Apple version.<br /><br />Cons: You will have a little finger memory adjustment to the different key spacing, which you will have with any keyboard unless you replace your current keyboard with the exact same one you have now.  No, it is not the 'whisper' quiet of the Apple. It doesn't have backlit keys, but I honestly can't remember if the Apple had it either since I work with the lights on.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"A good read and a good guy: This was an easy and fun read. MacLeod has led an interesting life and it seems he still is doing so.  Even before he played Murray on MTM he had a lot of roles and was mainly a character actor, playing the ""heavy"" frequently.  He tells us many interesting stories about those roles and his life during that time.<br /><br />He did have a regular stint on McHale's Navy but was basically a ""glorified extra.""  MacLeod says he only took the part because he thought the regular paycheck would help him raise his family.  But he hated the McHale's Navy gig and even attempted suicide during that part of his life.  He thought because of his contract that it would be hard to get out of playing that ""role"" and that he'd be stuck there for years.  But he did finally get out of it earlier than he thought he could.  So he was able to stretch himself again in more challenging roles.<br /><br />Of course he became the captain on The Love Boat and tells us many stories about that part of his life.  Being connected with that show allowed him to do lots of interesting things and he recounts much of that in the book.  We find out how he became a Christian during The Love Boat days and how that changed his life.<br /><br />MacLeod is classy in the way he shares his experiences.  Some people he met along the way were nasty but he doesn't badmouth them.  He mentions that there was a certain director on McHale's Navy who treated some of the actors (especially the older ones) very badly but he doesn't mention the director's name.  At another time Bette Davis comes to visit and the only negative thing he says is that he couldn't understand why she seemed so angry and aloof.<br /><br />There are many neat tidbits in the book.  For instance, he met Ted Knight way before MTM and Knight became like a big brother to him.  Another example: MacLeod was the original choice for Archie Bunker on All in the Family but he couldn't see himself saying the stuff that Archie would have to say so he passed on that role.  And then on MTM he was the original choice to play Lou Grant but he saw himself more as the Murray character so that's who he ended up playing.<br /><br />I could give many more examples but you can read the book yourself to find out.  As I said at the start, it's a fun read.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

I enjoyed reading your novel very much, though it is the second installment in your new trilogy and I have not read the first.<br /><br />This novel is a wonderful melange of conspiracy theory, end of the world cults, adventures in exotic locales, Mayan mythology and most of all, muscular Lovecroftian weird fiction (a la Laird Barron).  In my opinion, there were enough references to the first novel so the reader can piece together the history of the previous book.  I had no trouble following the characters and the plot, though I have not read the first book.  Enjoyed the book anyway.<br /><br />In short, the characters, dialogue and plot move well.  All the different genre elements mentioned above are well balanced to create a satisfying gestalt of a really great action-adventure/horror story.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the third installment of the trilogy.  Great book, Mr. Hughes!",5.0,Books,1,7

"Great Moive!  Great Songs Too!: A Christmas Carol is my favorite story and I have several versions of it.  This is the only musical that I have--the only one I've ever come across.

"Superb product for your beauty routine: As I mentioned in other reviews, I am a big fan of MelodySusie products. Mostly for nails, this is the first one I tried for skin care and was pleasantly surprised.<br />This hot/cold face (or body) massager is aesthetic, colors, design, material.<br />The back part is made of soft silicone that is super soft and prevents the device from slipping from your hand. I really enjoy touching that type of material.<br />The shape is ergonomic, easy to handle and be able to reach any part of your face. I have used it on my neck as well as the some parts of the upper back (great as hot therapy).<br />There are 2 buttons to operate, not very intuitive how to move from hot to cold, but the instructions are simple to follow (basically long press to turn it on in hot and once one press it again to switch to cold). Second button is to turn on/off the red and blue light.<br />This is a great option because you can easily open your pores if you want to do a facial without having to use  a facial steamer or taking a shower. And use it at the end of the facial to close your pores. OR just to give you a massage at the end of the day while watching tv.",5.0,Beauty_and_Personal_Care,1,6

"I highly recommend Ben and ""Influence with a Heart Method"" to any enterprise, in every demographic!: Ben Gioia is the ‘real deal’.<br /><br />Not just the business world, but the world-in-general would do well to have many more like Ben in it. Genuine and sincere doesn’t quite capture Ben’s heart (or soul, or center). I would give Ben the highest of recommendations to any enterprise who could benefit from his rare, professional-yet-altruistic, wealth of expertise and commitment to all in his orbit.

"Weird, illogical, joke of a plot, not worth your time: I've read Smoak's books before and enjoyed most of them, but this one is too weird. It jumps all over the place, not fully explaining anyIhing and totally not interesting. Nothing that happens is logical or believable. It was so strange, i actually thought she was going to pull a huge surprise and turn it around with a brilliant turn of events in the 2nd half of the book. The surprise was on me. Nothing is ever resolved and the promise of an understandable plot is a  joke. The only conclusion I can come to is Smoak was doing one of two things: either she was writing a story about a girl caught inside a strange video game, or Smoak herself was high on something when she wrote this. The only way she can possibly be getting 4 and 5 star ratings is that she ""bought"" them with offers of free books or whatever. Such a waste of my time and her talent because she is a good writer of some books - just not this one.",1.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"Higher Volume of Flame: Most of the propane torches available for plumbing and home use are &#34;pencil flame&#34; types - Which means the flame is less than a half inch in diameter. This is fine for most home plumbing repairs and soldering. However, for bending glass tubes (especially Pyrex glass) you need a bigger flame to heat the section you are going to bend.<br /><br />This torch has a larger diameter flame, about 3/4 of an inch in diameter. While the flame itself from this torch is not hotter than the pencil flame type torches - It puts out a bigger flame and more net heat. This comes in handy if you have somewhat larger item to heat or solder. While a quarter of an inch larger diameter may not sound that much bigger - the cross section area is a bit more than twice as much as the pencil torch flame.<br /><br />The torch is MADE IN THE USA and I am pleased with he quality and cost.

Since my husband drinks his coffee black and prefers it to be smooth tasting and not bitter, I add a tablespoon of ground coffee for every two cups of water I use and then finish it with the pinch of salt on the grounds before brewing.<br /><br />When I forget to add the pinch of salt, my husband immediately notices with his first drink, as it will taste more bitter to him.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

Greate upgrade from older DSM250: I have bought it directly from directed electronics few years back and when you upgrade with them it is way cheaper.

"Best Portable GPS Mount: This portable mount is great. My NUVI 660 clips right to it and the whole assembly sits on the dash of all (3) of my cars.

"Best dog bed we have ever owned!: We have had these dog beds for 6 months for our two Siberian Huskies.  They have been the best beds we have ever bought them.

"Superfun skateboard ramp set for our dollhouse: I thought that our dollhouse needed a little upgrade in the cool factor, and was delighted to find this little skate park kit that came with two skateboards. I guess that this is meant for grown-ups to play with the skateboards with their fingers, and their office? But we have been using all manner of action figures and dollhouse dolls, and calico critters, and letting them skateboard around and do tricks on this cool set of ramps, stairs, and rail.<br /><br />I found it overall easy to put together and easy to understand, and what I see in the picture is what I received in my set.

"This laptop is amazing!: Starting with the experience of having it in front of me and touching it, it's great. For those (including Acer staff) who say it's a 60 Hz display...they are wrong 'cause it comes with a 75 Hz monitor! It was a great discovering for me.  The temperature management is fantastic and the level of noise emissions is very low from my point of view, considering the huge amount of noise a simple Toshiba Satellite I have produces only opening an Excell file. So far I've test it with Alien Isolation at full graphics configuration and CPU temp is arround 81 degrees but with a curtain at 20cm from the rear exhaust. GPU is between 50 and 60 degrees. So far I had no need for using the extra fan and don't think I'll be necessary. The display is very nice with smooth gameplay thanks to G-Sync and the sound very powerfull and clear including some bass. If you're on the fence like I was, I strongly recommend it, you won't regret it. I spend a month doing research and know I feel I took the right choice. There are many light weight powerfull gaming laptops out there but not with this termal management and built quality.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Excellent value for a starter or extra set of 1/4 drive metric sockets: Got these to go in a vehicle for convenience and low-grade emergency adjustments. They cover a majority of a vehicle's socket needs for doing trim, upper and inside engine work, various engine room adjustments and so on. Obviously they aren't going to cover every size you need for a vehicle, but you can do quite a lot with a set like this.<br /><br />Quality seems fine -- none misshapen or cracked. The ""case"" if you could call it that is extremely cheap, so as you're building your order, plan to transfer them into an existing metal case (which is what I did), or to put them on a spring clip socket organizer.<br /><br />Value for the price is high -- I got a a 13mm and 14mm short and long socket, which were the sizes I needed, for about the same price as buying them individually at a store, but in this set I got every other size too. Silly-cheap for good quality.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

The book has a couple of models that make it worth getting.  For me the top two were the eight pointed star, and the candle. Both make good ornaments on my origami christmas trees.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Nice.: I actually got this to be able to hang from the ceiling. I needed to have a grow light for my ficus, geraniums etc… in the winter as well as in the spring my larger dahlias I wake for summer. I wanted a nice looking pendent lamp to use for the grow lights bc I didn’t want it to be obvious that it wasn’t a typical lamp. Now it looks like a normal lamp and no one knows the difference. The design is minimal which is nice. Powder coated matte black. Metal. Cord is nice and long which is awesome and convenient. Has two pieces attached to the cord to attach to the wall holding the wire flush to the walls. I didn’t use them tho. The one flaw I have is the switch on/off is so close to the plug, so when it goes into the wall I have to reach behind the cabinet where the plug is to turn on and off. Which is annoying. Other than that no problems. It’s an E26 fitting. I used a single grow light bulb E26 and worked perfectly. It def does the job and very versatile can be used anywhere and with many different aesthetics. Glad I got.",4.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

The pad will vibrate when you turn vibration on, but in such things as the Lego series (Starwars, Batman, Indy), Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Battlestar Galactica, I get no vibration in game.

Instantly intrigued, yet feeling like a true cougar, Janie hesitantly engages in time spent with this young guy. Wise beyond his years, Zade does wonders for Janie's soul, providing healing from an unexpected place.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:  Right off the bat, I was taken with the beauty of this book. The dedication page alone was stunning.<br /><br />&#34;To every person who's given tirelessly to others and awakened to find they've lost themselves. I hope you find your colors and paint a masterpiece.&#34;<br /><br />So beautifully stated, and fitting for the theme of the book. For the mid- thirties to forties age group, it's a common feeling us women share. We've spent the past chunk of years caring for our children, our partner, and our home... only to find a piece of ourselves missing in the process. Not all of us have had our lives travel the same path as Janie, yet some of the feelings we bear are drastically similar. Loss of self, and struggling body image amongst the leaders of the pack.<br /><br />It's with these sentiments that I immediately find myself whole-heartedly cheering on our protagonist, hoping she finds her release. I don't have to hope for long though. *Enter stud muffin Zade* He's a sweet talking, mature and confident man, despite being 14 years Janie's junior. He's the perfect someone to pull Janie out of her shell, and introduce her to a life of adventure, a happy life worth living to the fullest extent. The heat between these two is off-the-charts explosive. He literally brings out a side of her that Janie didn't even know existed, resulting in Janie's liberation... in SO many ways!<br /><br />I truly loved this story, and reveled in Janie's growth. It was beautiful, freeing, and just plain HOT to read about these two finding their way together. What I did NOT enjoy though, was the ending. There was such a build up of feelings and emotions, only to have an abrupt finish. If a different ending had been delivered, this story could very well have garnered 5 stars from me. Bummer!<br /><br />I'll tell you something else I DID love though... the boat scene. The single happening on the catamaran trip was a beautiful metaphor for what was taking place deep inside Janie. It was just beautiful!! I almost cried. I wanted to give her a big hug and tell her how proud I was of her. Though, that would be a bit tough being that she's a fictional character, right?!? Some scenes just seem 'that' real and moving, and this was one of them.

"An easier o read Tolkien: &#34;Through The Wildwood - The Legend of Vanx Malic Book 1&#34; was very reminiscent of some of J.R. Tolkien's books but much easier to read through. I liked the way that while manynof the characters names and namesmof other creatures were fictional and made to sound other worldly they were still easier enough to pronounce that it did not leave me wondering if I was getting the names even close to right. As a cat lover I enjoyed the idea of the haulkattens. I hate complaining about this, since itmcould just be my reader even though it has never happened before, but for some reason &#34;Chapter Three&#34; kept on reappearing during this book when it was in the middle of a chapter and had just ended a paragraph the first few times was very confusing and I found the effect distracting even though it was just the banner with the words &#34;Chapter Three&#34;.

"Unstoppable and Awesome!: This thing is amazing! I bought it for my 12 year old but I want to drive it as much as he does! It has proportional speed and steering which is a must in an RC. It steers by running the tracks in opposite directions and you can ""steer"" while the vehicle isn't moving, resulting in the ability to spin in circles.  When driving, you can steer quickly or slowly so it is very easy to control. I have owned many RCs in my life and this one doesn't disappoint. It is one of my first tracked vehicles and it runs amazingly. It has suspension in the tracks to allow it to run smoothly over very rough surfaces. It runs just as easily on grass and gravel as it does on pavement which is amazing! The only thing it isn't great at is climbing steep inclines because it has a tendency to tip backwards. But it makes up for this by traveling so effortlessly over rough terrain. The body is awesome looking and very detailed with an opening cockpit (both doors open independently). The battery is on the small side but still offers about a 15-20 minute run time depending on speed and terrain. I really like that they made room in the battery compartment for the charger so you don't have to worry about losing track of it. The controller is fairly typical for RC vehicles in this price point and works well. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase and considering buying a second so we don't need to fight over it!",5.0,Toys_and_Games,1,31

"Love this story!: Several years ago, at one of the Smithsonian museums, I purchased a book titled ""The Good Old Days-They Were Terrible"". I love that book because it reminds me that every time period has its challenges and overcoming those challenges will always require taking a stand to make a change.  Reading ""Among The Pages"", a novel from the split-time genre, reminded me of that other book.<br /><br />This novel shares the story of two women who lived 100 years apart. The present-day heroine, Brianne, is a college student facing several challenges as she navigates her college experience. The other heroine in the story is Margaret. Margaret is a teacher living in 1915 and facing the challenges involved with the Women’s Rights Movement during that era. Brianne learns about Margaret through a diary she finds in the attic of her parents’ house. As she follows Margaret’s thoughts and experiences expressed in the diary, Brianne will find that her challenges, while different, will always require taking a stand for what you believe.<br /><br />I don’t want to provide any spoilers. So I will simply state that the wonderful thing about stories like these is the reader can often relate to the situations presented. The challenges faced by women today still require taking a stand if you want changes to occur. I enjoyed this story because there are many women who will be able to identify with the heroines.<br /><br />I voluntarily reviewed an Advanced Reader Copy of this book provided by the author via BookFunnel but the thoughts and opinions in this review are totally my own.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"4.5 stars: The book started out extremely strong and it hooked me instantly. The initial meeting of the two MCs was incredibly sexy and pulled me in. The introduction of other characters was also well done and the background story was excellent. This was very close to being a 5 star book and it very well might have been if the heat level was a lot more toned down because that’s the one flaw and not because the scenes were badly written (they were among some of the better ones I’ve read and were definitely steamy!!) they just felt out of place and not genuine. It was like the author conflated physical and emotional connection because while Lucas & Elliot definitely had a strong physical connection, it seemed the emotional connection was lacking. I think if more time had been spent describing and exploring their developing friendship rather than glossing over it with brief summaries of activities they shared and then jumping straight to the bedroom, the romance would have been more compelling and believable. Regardless, the rest of the story nearly made up for the lackluster romance. It was a very interesting topic and exploration of criminal justice, incarceration, and criminal defense. The story was well written and edited so that it felt like a professional work and it held my interest almost completely. All in all this was nearly a 5 star book for me. 4.5 stars",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"I NO LONGER LOVE THIS!: FOLLOW UP: This material wrinkles very easily. After two wears and two washes, the wrinkles are so bad. Each time, I had to send it out to be steamed to remove the wrinkles. That's extra expense. Pretty soon laundering it will cost more than this dress itself. I was afraid I might have to revise my LOVE (3) first review. And, here you go. Very disappointed. It is something nice to wear until the wrinkles shows up and stay wrinkled and time to get steamed and have the wrinkles removed.<br /><br />I normally wear a medium; however, I read that these come small. I ordered an XXL and fits perfectly on me. It arrived exactly a month from date of order. But, can't wear it anyway until it gets warm here in the DC area. The tag says it's COTTON. I hope I do not have to post a follow up that the fabric shrunk after washing the first time. It feels like microfiber (cotton/poly combo). But for now, this is a great surprise.

The coatings on them have survived many drops without suffering excessive wear so they are vary resilient in my opinion.  The stylus is also very well made and durable. Even though the styluses on these pens are not indestructible, the ones on mine each lasted about 2 and a half months before wearing out from constant use and from frequent drops.  The pen is very reliable and writes very well and the ink cartridge holds more than enough ink to do a moderate amount of writing before needing to be replaced.  The bubble level in these pens is also a neat feature.  I used it as a line level to level a wall mounted storage rack once and it worked perfectly.",5.0,Office_Products,1,24

"Essential.: I own the Collected Works of Victor Hugo, 15 vols. Last summer I found the time to read all of them. I must say that The Toilers of the Sea, in the end, strikes me as the best book Hugo ever wrote. Sure, we have The Hunchback of Notre Dame. And Les Miserables. But Toilers of the Sea got to me more, okay? Somehow I identified with Gilliat more than with Quasimodo and Jean Valjean combined. He's a very realistic character, unlike the overly miserable hunchback or the overly saintly Valjean, and his struggles are very realistic, which makes the reader care far more about whether he succeeds or not.<br />Hugo had spent some years in Jersey/Guernsey, where the book takes place, and I suppose that observing the sea was all there was to do there, since in the book it's clear that he knows every little aspect of it. The sea is just as prominent a character as Gilliat, and just as realistic, and has even more space devoted to it than any of the humans. It's hard to think of it as inanimate after reading this book. The imagery of the storm is certainly unforgettable.<br />This book is more touching than Hugo's others, maybe because the author focuses more on telling a story rather than a Big Important Social Message About the Plight of the Poor. There's humor, there's tragedy, there's drama, and the result is a very immersive read.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Expensive, but ADDICTINGLY DELICIOUS: I recently tried the Peanut Butter Banana Dark Chocolate KIND Breakfast Protein Bars, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good they were.<br /><br />The bars are a great breakfast or snack option for people who are always on the go because they are simple to grab and carry. Additionally, they are loaded with protein and other healthy ingredients, so I feel good about choosing them as a snack.<br /><br />Dark chocolate, peanut butter, and banana make for a really delicious and satisfying flavor combination. The bars have a pleasant texture that isn't overly chewy or crunchy, and there's no odd aftertaste.<br /><br />The only reason I gave these bars four instead of five stars is because they are a little too sweet for my taste. I like that they use honey and maple syrup as natural sweeteners, but I still think they're a little too sugary.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a nutritious and delectable snack, I'd highly suggest the KIND Breakfast Protein Bars.

I also like how it has a hole on the inside of the case for the lens of the camera, it makes it easier for access. The removable cross body strap can make this case a purse to help your look, or you could just take the strap off and just put the case in your purse. This is awesome as a purse because of the plain, black leatherish color that it has, it looks like a normal purse!

"I LOVE MY TENT!: I'm very impressed with this tent, I had originally bought it from Backcountry Edge for $125 and now the price has dropped on Amazon to $80, total steal!!! I have gone on two camping trips to Acadia, Maine and now on my way to Sacandaga Lake, NY. On my 2nd trip to Acadia we (3 people in the tent) experienced a rain storm, pouring rain, lightning and thunder...the works. There wasn't a drop of rain inside my tent and the 2 vestibules kept our shoes and other items dry.<br /><br />It's sturdy, spacious, very easy to set up (15-20 min) and if you ask me...a pretty good looking tent! The detail of 2 doors is super great, no need to climb over anyone.<br /><br />Helpful Tip: I wasn't crazy about the smooth metal stakes that it came with so I bought additional stakes (Coghlan's ABS Tent Peg) for under $1.00 each and used those for the actual tent. I used the Slumberjack standard stakes for the rainfly/vestibule and ventilation ties.<br /><br />As long as you secure the tent and rainfly properly (including the side-release buckle ties) you should not have any issue with ventilation at all. The tent stays dry through the heat, cold and rain.<br /><br />Sadly, the gear loft and footprint are sold separately but it's also worth the buy!<br /><br />Interesting Find: In my research, before buying this product, I found out that ""Slumberjack is a division of American Recreation Products (ARP), St. Louis, which owns a variety of high-performance outdoor brands, including Kelty®, Sierra Designs® and Royal Robbins®"", Kelty sit/news.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004Y6MJIC Slumberjack Trail Tent Footprint]]",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Dark, Spooky, Tribal - with hints of Classic Numan: We all anxiously waited, and waited a very long time. I confess when I first listened to ""Jagged"" I was lukewarm. Maybe I had certain expectations - who knows? It just didn't strike me.<br /><br />Now I confess to you something else - after repeated listenings this album really pulled me in. Songs that didn't really do anything for me at first are now standout favorites (Slave, In a Dark Place, Melt), and songs like Halo and Haunted will fit right in at your next heavy metal bash.<br /><br />I'm surprised at the indifferent reviews found here that claim this is ""Pure - Part II"". I don't get that vibe at all - there are some bits and pieces here that just might remind you of ""I, Assassin"" or ""Warriors"". Listen to it a bunch and listen to it loud.

"Horrifying: This is the scariest movie I think I have ever seen.  It started off kinda lame, but that was part of what lulled you into watching it not expecting what was coming next.  The fact that it was based on a true story and that at the end during the credits it shows the people involved made it scarier even though the movie was over.  If you love horror/thriller type movies, this will freak you smooth out.  The blood and gore was kept to a minimum, the movie didn't need that to be horrifying.  I watched it alone and in the dark, because that's how I like to watch scary movies.  Big mistake.  LOL.  I recommend this highly, but I won't be watching it again.  That's how scary it is.  Don't let any kids see this, even though there's no nudity or much blood, it will terrify them.  Use your own judgement, but I would never let kids under about 16 see it.  I literally prayed after it was over as if I had let evil into my house.  I don't remember a movie that made me feel like that.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

The wand never was very powerful, so I kept my Dyson to use it's powerful wand. I've had this 2 years and it's falling apart now. First, the short handle cracked where it attached to the wand. I used duct tape and solved that. Next, plastic on the base cracked so it won't stand up on its own, anymore. I propped it up and dealt with it falling over constantly for a few weeks. Then the clear plastic hose between the base and the tank of the vacuum split. The Dyson wasn't as great for carpets, but I've had it 12 years and nothing on it has broken.

"Exciting and New Apocalypse Story: I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this story. Michelle Ann Hollstein creates a detailed and attention grabbing story. I never saw some of the twists coming. This is different than other zombie type stories.

Each character faces their own set of circumstances and struggles. The way Michelle writes is so detailed you can perfectly envision everything! Its not just the infected they have to worry about but the crazy non infected too! This is a brillant twist to traditional apocalypse books and I can't wait to see what happens next!!

"Solid thunderbolt dock for your M1 Macbook Pro: The tough problem I see with most thunderbolt docks is they try to balance all the potential ports you might need, trying to find the right mix of everything. And I just couldn't find something that suited my needs without costing 2-3 times what this dock costs.<br /><br />This dock allows you to get what you need out of it in whatever way you need it. It's not going to fast charge your M1 MBP, but it'll run it without a problem. I can, then, decide what the Type-C/Thunderbolt ports do for me. Yeah, there's not a lot of ports to work with, but I really didn't need a ton to begin with.<br /><br />This thing keeps it simple. As a result, it's small and easy to stash away. If you need more, thanks to Thunderbolt, you can daisy chain them, or plug a second dock directly into the MBP's second Thunderbolt port. If you don't need more Type-C ports, you can get a basic hub to plug in to the Type-A port that's available.<br /><br />I ended up not using the included HDMI adapter. I've not been able to find a USB-C to HDMI dongle that works correctly with my ultrawide monitor. This one included. It might do 4K or 8K in a more common display format. I couldn't tell you, though.<br /><br />For me: Mouse/keyboard in the Type-A port, DisplayPort to Type-C cable in another of the Type-C ports, external storage for Time Machine in another Type-C port, Anker conference bar in the last Type-C port. All ports are occupied, and I have a single cable going into the MBP providing all of this and power.<br /><br />It's light enough and small enough that I ended up mounting it under my desk with some 3M Dual-Lock.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Perfection In Every Detail: With endless undercurrents and nuances.  Tells the story  of many with the perfect depth wether it be a 2 minute interaction or a 10 min dialouge the writing never wavers and the actors deliver noteworthy performances. It feels like a softly scratched up , gently scarred snail shell left in the grass for nature to reclaim her story . There are a  multitude of tales curved beautifully around each other. The connections are there, you can't miss them, and this gem leaves a deep imprint on the psyche and the heart.

"Unbelievably Riveting: I finally got my hands on a copy of Educated and I am so glad that I was able to immerse myself in this read.

"The Cobra iRadar app is useless in the state I live: Way too many false alarms. I have messed with every setting possible and I get multiple false alarms every, single, trip.  Half the semi trucks on the road set it off, random cars set it off, and then there is just random times it goes off for no apparent reason.  Often I will ride 2 miles with the lowest alert level going off, on a major highway with nothing around me, no idea why.<br /><br />The Cobra iRadar app is useless in the state I live, Michigan. I travel between GR, Kzoo, Lansing, Detroit, Ann Arbor, Midland, and never once has there been another user alert or one of there &#34;national database&#34; of common speed traps.  The only use for it is that when you are connected, the radar detector shows your speed and compass direction.  The speed I understand (needs GPS), but the direction should be shown regardless of phone connection.  I can buy a $5 digital direction tool that I stick to my dash, this could incorporate that technology easily. If not connected to phone it shows your battery voltage in huge numbers (useless?).<br /><br />There are so many common sense options that are missing I don't have the time.  The most obvious is for ME to set where I see speed traps often, even if they aren't there at that moment.  Nope.  Other detectors have this.  I should also remember where the false alerts are, nope. Again other detectors have this.  Every time I drive by lowes on my regular commute I have to hear the darn thing, no matter how many times I click ignore.<br /><br />I had my last radar detector 10 years ago, this is no better a decade later and at twice the price. Maybe it was a matter of expectations, but I can't recommend as I wouldn't buy it again.  Pretty disappointing.",2.0,Electronics,0,12

"Ruined by Typical, One-Trick Pony Hollywood Agenda: Spoiler alert: Read no further if you haven’t yet seen The Imitation Game, or the ending will herein be spoiled.<br /><br />Only the self-absorbed, superficial, affluent, elitist, agenda-driven film industry/Hollywood can whittle a riveting, life and death, free-world apocalypse, WWII drama down to its most pressing issue: the “horror” of the illegality and moral disapprobation of homosexuality.<br /><br />Yes, indeed, folks, homosexuality.<br /><br />Shame on the western world for not seeing through the dust, destruction, rubble, advancing evil of the Third Reich, bloodshed, bombings, separation of children from their families, and the thousands of body bags of loved ones to realize that homosexuals couldn’t have fulfilling sex lives in the face of current law. How self-centered and ignorant of us to have been distracted by the low priority of the encroaching and ever-growing occupation by Germany not to recognize that sexual lust and proclivities were being societally suppressed! Bad, bad, bad society! Worse than the Nazi Menace!<br /><br />Once the film’s agenda starts clicking into place by the end of the film, you “get it.” You get what the backstory is all about, and it’s not about bullying.<br /><br />Scraping off the film’s complete and unsettling whitewash of older classmate Christopher as the kindly, protective White Knight to young Mr. Turing, one recognizes that Christopher was, indeed, nothing more than a stereotypical sexual predator.<br /><br />Mr. Turing was chosen by Christopher, Christopher’s mark. Mr. Turing was low-hanging fruit: a young, lonely, bullied, vulnerable, helpless, innocent, asperger-afflicted, alienated  boy.  Older classmate Christopher groomed this emotionally-isolated Turing, taking him under his “protective” wing. But not for pure benevolence, but so Christopher could fulfill his own predatory lust.<br /><br />It’s Christopher who is responsible for the ultimate suicide of Turing, not societal mores.<br /><br />That Christopher is presented sympathetically and heroic makes this NAMBLA-esque homosexual agenda of The Imitation Game that much more heinous and repugnant.",3.0,Movies_and_TV,0,22

"This book is pretty dark, you should know that going in.: It’s like the dark alley shortcut you shouldn’t take on the way home from the bar but know you’re going to anyway. If you have a trigger, this book will set it off.<br />You know the part in the Twilight books (yeah, I read them, so what?) Anyway, remember when Bella so desperately wanted to be turned into a monster, but a nice one, who used her powers for good? The protagonist in this book is the opposite of that. She wants to be a monster too . . . so she can exact vengeance on the dirt bags of the world. Mostly by ripping them apart and eating bits of them.<br />In a way, it’s like being saved by a unicorn. No really, think about that. Imagine you’re in a filthy alley (hey, you chose to go this way), huddled against a dumpster. A monster (could be a troll, ogre, Jehovah's Witness, whatever you personally find terrifying) looms over you with a knotty club, a rusty knife, or a copy of the Watchtower. At the last possible moment before getting clubbed, stabbed, or proselytized to, a unicorn gallops in and saves you. How would that work? How would a unicorn, a creature clearly lacking opposable thumbs, save you? More than likely, the unicorn would ram its spiral horn through the monster’s chest, showering you with torrents of blood, chunks of pale pink lungs, and shattered bits of bleached white ribs.<br />And the smell. Oh god, the smell. As if the dumpster you were huddled against didn’t smell bad enough. Now there’s a stench like rusted metal and rotten meat from the blood and innards, and that’s before the monster’s bowels let go. Yeah. That just happened. What then? Once the unicorn manages to shake the impaled monster off its horn (no thanks to you) by tossing its head vigorously and manically pawing with its forelegs, what do you do?<br />While you ponder, the unicorn stares at you. It blinks the blood out of its eyes awaiting your decision. Sure, its back half is still a pristine white, but the front half looks like a cheerleader’s uniform in a slasher movie. Don’t ask the unicorn for advice, it can’t talk. This one’s on you, what choice will you make?<br />If you think you’d avert your eyes and mumble your thankyous before scrambling out of the mouth of the alley to run the rest of the way home, the whole time swearing you’ll never spend another night chasing Jager bombs with shots of bottom shelf tequila, pausing only to be noisily sick on the sidewalk as you rest one hand against the rough exterior brick of a dentist’s office, then this book is not for you.<br />But, if you’d climb aboard the unicorn and lean against the back of its head, letting the cooling blood soak into the front of your favorite t-shirt as you wrap your fingers in its gore-soaked mane before the two of you ride off into the darkness searching for others to save, then this is most definitely the book for you.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

Please note that these gloves are intended to protect your hands from kitchen knives.  Despite the fact that Amazon chose to select ""heat resistance"" as one of the ratings criteria, these gloves should NOT be used to remove items from the oven.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

I have two of these that have served me well for nearly fifteen years. At maybe $25 each these have been among the best value-for-money music accessories I've ever bought. They've gotten glitchy the last couple of years, seemingly from a loose connection inside the unit, which I can't even try to fix because I can't find any way to open it.<br /><br />Since nearly all reviews here are more than ten years old and the couple of ones that are only about five years old are about how well this still works after ten years, I guess Amazon's ""temporarily out of stock"" can mean ""stopped being produced over ten years ago."" Doesn't really meet the lowest threshold for accuracy by an online retailer.<br /><br />Bonus annoyance, Amazon doesn't have any way to sort reviews by date, so I had to scroll through 80-plus of them to make sure no one had bought this recently.

These are the best most comfortable water shoes I have ever found. They're more of a pink than a purple color though.<br /><br />I imagine I would wear them most of the day if I had a pair to wait out of the house, but these are for the pool.

"Good, not great.: Product looks as described in the picture and came with everything shown. The quality of the plastic appears good for the price, however in most cases the lids did not comfortable connect to the body of the containers (the containers sides caved in a bit forcing me to pull them outwards so that the lid would fit in. All of the snapping mechanisms, including the pouring port are tight and seem very secure. The pour out of this thing is very satisfying... it's large and the cereal does not collect or bunch up trying to get out which is nice over previous cereal containers I've owned.<br /><br />Even with the lid on and snapped, however, it just doesn't seem like it has the best airtight seal. It looks as though it has the gaskets, but the way the lid goes on makes it feel like the body is just touching the gaskets and not actually creating a seal with them. It remains to be seen just how fresh this keeps my cereal.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have is that the listed dimensions are off. The claimed width of the product is 3.35"" which appears to be the width of the body and does not take into account the extra width that the locking snaps on the lid take. I was expecting the six of these to easily fit on a 24 inch shelf but they do not. The actual width of the container with the lid on and secured is about 4.3"". As a self-professed pack rat, I can tell you that this misrepresentation completely throws off my pantry plans and is very nearly unforgivable. Now I probably have to buy a new house just to make these fit properly.<br /><br />Anyway, as long as your aware of what you're getting, you should be able to plan accordingly. They should update the product page, however.",3.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

The suit seems well-made and I think it will last awhile. It covers a lot, but does not look frumpy; I would describe it as looking athletic.

"Too Cheap to work, Flimsy: this is the cheapest worthless item to scrape popcorn you can buy.  The metal flange between the handle and scraper will bend with almost no weight on it.

Great coverage and a little pressure so it is absorbed better and you use less water.  Either a ladder or drywall stilts and a 10 drywall knife and a 12 by 12 room took about 20 minutes total.

It's obvious Lee Child has a decent vocabulary -- not Shakespeare, but fine for this genre -- so time to find a different way of expressing indecision.<br /><br />And even a very-long-in-the-tooth reader like myself finds Jack attractive. But . . . yeah, there it is again: an apparently gorgeous policewoman is putting her job at considerable risk, jumping into the sack with him at first opportunity, getting him an untraceable gun, shrugging....<br /><br />Still, a good read.

"Lots of fun - at least the way we use it: I picked up one of these metal detectors back in April, when they were on sale as a Lightening Deal. Years ago I had owned a metal detector and remembered we had a lot of fun using it - so I thought this might be neat to play with this summer.  (And I was apparently right.)<br /><br />The metal detector I had over 20 years ago had been made of metal and had been pretty heavy (not to mention the weight all the C batteries it took to power it. This one by Winbest is very light, almost to the point it feels like a toy (several people asked me if it was a real metal detector after picking it up and discovering how light it is). Part of the reason for the light weight is this unit is powered by two 9-volt batteries - the main reason is it's made mostly out of plastic and aluminum. I like that it is so light weight, as that makes it easy to carry around and young kids can use it with no problems (the shaft length is adjustable which is good for kids who might be a bit lower to the ground than an adult).<br /><br />The metal detector comes disassembled - so there is some assembly required. Nothing too complicated, just attaching a few parts to other parts, and you don't even need any tools - everything screws together with knobs designed to be tightened with your fingers.<br /><br />Operation of this metal detector is pretty straight forward - you adjust the sensitivity and then sweep the head of the detector back and forth till you hear a squeal indicating the head is over some sort of metal. There are three knobs that control things - a volume knob for setting how loud the squeal will be (there is a headphone jack if you prefer to not bother other people), a knob for setting how sensitive the detector is (set too high and you get a lot of false positives), and a knob for adjusting what sort of metal the detector will detect (I recommend keeping this on the default setting). Plus there is an analog meter that displays a scale from 0-10 (if I remember right it's an indication of how strong a signal is - or how big a piece of metal is. I never really look at it as the sound of the squeal will tell you pretty much the same thing.)<br /><br />I can say we used this detector quite a bit this spring - when my relatives came down and stayed in one of the local RV parks I loaned it to them and they had a blast with it - even though they mainly just found old soda/beer can pull-tops. I think it's the possibility of discovering something of value that is what makes for the thrill.<br /><br />One thing I should mention - if you get a metal detector, don't use it around the outside of your home - or at least not within say 10 feet of it. The reason for that recommendation is that when houses get built there is a lot of trash left behind. So if you do explore near your house - expect to find a lot of bent nail, and other pieces of metal debris.<br /><br />We came up with a game using this metal detector. I have about a dozen of the old Eisenhower dollar coins (culls with the cladding flaking off), and we hide them in the grass and have someone try to find them within a set amount of time. Simple little game, but you would be surprised at how evolved people get playing it (not only the kids, the adults too).<br /><br />This metal detector can detect metal to about a 6"" depth - least that has been my experience with the one I bought. Which is fine with me, the soil here is hard clay and you don't really want to dig a lot of holes (even small ones) deeper than that. The detector head is water proof - but I wouldn't use it in anything deeper than a few inches.<br /><br />So to wrap it up, I really am happy I bought this metal detector when I did - it's been a fun activity this summer, even if we  didn't find any buried treasure (yet).<br /><br />Just in case it might be of interest to anyone, the box this comes in is big - but not overly large, 23 1/2"" x 4 1/2"" x 8"".<br /><br />Review for - Winbest by Barska Pro Edition Metal Detector model BE11638",5.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,1,25

The side rails in the cabinet prevent any air bypassing the filter, even though it is not a perfect fit.

"LIKE A ROSE Is In Full Bloom!: Thank God for Miranda Lambert. I've been a fan since Day One, when, after her third place finish on the first season of ""Nashville Star"", I turned to my friends and predicted that, not only would Sony sign her and nurture and groom her, they would make her a HUGE star!<br />  Now, ten years later, Lambert is unstoppable, with pretty much everything she touches turning to gold (or platinum!).<br />  Case in point...the debut effort from her side group Pistol Annies. I gotta be honest here...I wasn't too thrilled initially about the prospect of said project. I thought it might dilute Lambert's work (And, to tell you the truth, I still think her best material ended up on HELL ON HEELS, thus causing her fourth solo release ~ FOUR THE RECORD ~ to be her weakest overall to date).<br />  However, there's no denying HELL ON HEELS was a whole lot of fun. Better yet, it introduced most of us to two ladies ~ Angaleena Presley and Ashley Monroe ~ who could hold their own with the formidable Lambert, no small feat in itself! Monroe, in particular, impressed me...at times, there was just something about her that reminded me of a young Dolly Parton.<br />  In light of the success of HELL ON HEELS, it was only a matter of time before we saw solo albums pop up. Monroe's LIKE A ROSE is an absolute gem. Yes, the Lambert influence is there (particularly in the lyrics!), but Monroe is definitely her own woman...where Lambert is as much rock as she is country, Monroe is pure country with a dash of pop thrown in. The result? An artist already in full bloom!<br />  Things kick off with the disc's sublime title track. Amid a delicate arrangement, the subtle, supple lead vocal dances over the powerful lyrics: ""I was only 13 when Daddy died/Momma started drinking and my brother just quit trying/I'm still bouncing back/Heaven only knows/How I came out like a rose."" Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Ashley Monroe's calling card...announcing her arrival!<br />  I'd like to think that if Dolly and Miranda ever wrote a song together, it would sound just like ""Two Weeks Late."" Full of both humor and pathos, Monroe delivers a relaxed, yet spirited, lead vocal. However, the true star here is the instrumentation, particularly Paul Franklin's steel guitar and Tony Harrell's piano. A winner from top to bottom!<br />  However, the disc's absolute masterpiece is the dark (yet insanely tuneful!) ""Used."" Graced with a lovely lead vocal, great harmonies and pitch-perfect instrumentation (each instrument gets it's own moment to shine!), the song's true core is it's lyrics...they're sheer poetry. Vivid in their imagry, heartfelt in their honesty, it doesn't get better than this. Trust me, Monroe has crafted an instant classic here!<br />  Anything following ""Used"" would pale in comparison, but ""Weed Instead Of Roses"" has a particularly rough time. The fact of the matter is, the song's just not that good...it's overly cute, it's overly clever and it's just WAY below the standards of the rest of the album (Kudos to John Jarvis, though, for his KILLER piano playing!).<br />  ""You Got Me"" shows off Monroe's versatility. As much a pop song as anything, she's still able to infuse it with a healthy dose of country twang. This stylish hybrid just tumbles out of the speakers, thanks in part to a haunting arrangement and a hypnotic lead vocal. Not one of my favorites initially, I've come to really appreciate this song. Another winner.<br />  Up next is the album's other stand-out cut, the powerful story/song ""The Morning After."" Yes, the melody is understated, but it's oh, so, infectious....it gets in your head and stays there LONG after the song...heck, the whole album!...has ended! The instrumentation, the lead vocal, the harmonies....everything is sheer perfection! Love, love, LOVE this song! (On a side note, I can think of two or three people who should cover this beaut!).<br />  Much like ""Weed Instead Of Roses"", ""Monroe Suede"" is a tad bit slight when you compare it to the rest of the album. Yes, the arrangement is a real toe-tapper, and Monroe delivers the song with a sly, assured vocal, but ~ and this is a BIG ""but!"" ~ there's just something hollow and half-baked about the track. Good....but not great. We'll call this one a draw.<br />  There's a forelorn quality to ""She's Driving Me Out Of Your Mind"" that really tugs at your heartstrings. The arrangement is shaded and somber, yet, surprisingly, absolutely captivating, while the lead vocal is strong, simple and sweet. This is a classic country tune ~ just look at that title! ~ yet it sounds fresh and contemporary.<br />And that, my friends, is Monroe's true gift...the ability to straddle ~ and conquer! ~ all worlds, genres and styles. In other words, a true artist!<br />  The album ends (albeit WAY too soon!)with the hilarious ""You Ain't Dolly (And You Ain't Porter)"", a wonderful duet with Blake Shelton. True, there's not a whole lot to the cut, but who cares? It's FUN! Both Monroe and Shelton are in fine form vocally, and I love the lines ""You'll probably see me country singing on The Voice someday/Yeah and I'm the guy they wrote about in ""Fifty Shades Of Grey""!"" A great way to wrap things up!<br />  I just wish there was more to enjoy...at just nine tracks, LIKE A ROSE ends just as you're really getting into it! Even one or two more cuts would have made a world of difference! That said, there's no denying that the album announces the arrival of a true star. Ashley Monroe is the real deal, and I, for one, can't wait to see what she does on her second release...and her third...and her fourth...and....! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics...strong ones like these NEED to be read!).",4.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Perfect - the right continuation of the series: The success of the Mackerras/Telarc MIKADO prompted Mackerras to choose PIRATES as his second entry. And he gives it a fresh, imaginative performance with his first-class team of starry singers and dedicated, alert forces. Richard Suart's Major-General shows him easily surpassing John Reed. He finds more subtle nuances in this part, and he gives a delectable performance of his pater song that rarely sounds rushed. No doubt D'Oyly Carte experience has geared him up for this. Donald Adams, despite a hiatus after recording the part of the Pirate King with D'Oyly Carte, still shows himself in glorious voice, and continually keeping touch, even despite his age. The romantic edge of the opera is perfectly brought out by John-Mark Ainsley's heady-toned and lyrical Frederic and Rebecca Evans's creamy Mabel, who inject a certain magic into the Act Two duet, Ah leave me not to pine alone. And what should also be considered special are Gillian Knight's bright-toned and shining Ruth and Richard Van Allan's bumptuous Sergeant of Police. Run for your money, Owen Brannigan! Van Allan has managed to fit the character of the Sergeant a little more with his voice-shaping. And he certainly sounds a little bit more flattered and comical than you, incereasing the freshness in his portrayal until it surpasses yours. The chorus is superbly disciplined, the orchestral playing alert and imaginative, and Mackerras gives his own inimitable touch to the overall result. Telarc's recording is perfectly faultless, with nothing to gripe about, and it caps a performance that sparkles more than D'Oyly Carte's 1968 Decca recording.<br />P.S. Some may gripe about the lack of dialogue. This recording only contains the music, except for the Overture, which could not be fitted onto a single disc.",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

If it had a button to run the machine through one heating cycle and turn off, then it would be much safer and easier on our power consumption if we forget it is on. There have been a few times we forget the switch is on because the light even turns off after a cycle, leave to run errands, and come back and it is trying to reheat what water is left in it.

Furthermore, there is a great deal of excellent discussion on Anne's personal characteristics and whether or not Holbein portrayed her accurately in his portrait.

"Lost souls makes for great comedy: I thought I had this movie figured out before I saw it.  In Bruges appeared to be a hyperactive, hip, cool and ironic crime flick with lots of style but little substance.  Imagine my suprise when I discovered a funny, sad and powerful film about two hitmen laying low in Belgium after a botched hit and wrestling with their demons at the same time.  Sound too heavy?  It's not.<br /><br />Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleesan star as the two hitmen stuck in the glum city of Bruges awaitng orders from their boss (Ralph Feinnes).  Gleesan wants to lay low and wait for their boss to call, but Farrell prefers to go out and take in the night life (what little there is) and his trips bring him into contact with midgets, obese tourists and a girl who tries to scam him out of his money but who he eventually falls for.  All of this provides for deeply hilarious and sometimes darkly comic moments that make this one of the funniest films of the year.<br /><br />But there is more going on here than just laughs.  Farrell is haunted by the accidental murder of a child during his first hit.  As much as he tries to hide from what he did by drinking and doing drugs, the truth always catches up with him.  Farrell does a teriffic job of capturing the guilt that is eating away at his character's soul.<br /><br />The film flips back and fort between the comedy of the two mens' misadventures in Bruges, and the drama of their attempts to atone for their sins.  Neither facet of the film feels forced or contrived.  It all meshes together nicely.  And when Ralph Feinnes shows up in the film's final act, he just adds to the hilarity and moral complexity with his underrated performance.<br /><br />In Bruges doesn't end on a feel good high, but it is a movie that instills you with a sense of hope that people can change and become better than what their circumstances have forced them to be. Most movies of this type don't even try to say something that meaningful. That puts In Bruges in a class by itself.",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"On paper they shouldn't fit.: ***** I was gifted a copy of Underneath it all in exchange for an honest review *****<br /><br />Underneath it all is the fourth book in the Decadent Series. Each books angst and emotional intensity increasing with each story. To me Giovanni and Darren's being the most mind blowing.<br /><br />Giovanni is struggling and scared not for just himself but everyone around him, he's struggling to accept his schizophrenia and adjust to life outside the safety of the hospital. He can't fathom why Tam forgives him for causing such hurt. So he's self imposed a very narrow path to live within and he's ready to walk and live it alone. Save anyone getting hurt by him again.<br /><br />Fate and destiny have other plans for Giovanni and he goes by the name of Darren, whose recently transferred to Briarwood amidst a cloud of rumours and gossip. Trying to live his life the best he can while trying to keep his demons at bay and his past behind him the best he can.<br /><br />On paper they shouldn't fit One trying to live with his past, One trying to cope with the future.<br /><br />&#34;Welcome every problem as an opportunity.Each moment is the greatest challenge, the best thing that ever happened to you. The more difficult the problem the greater the challenge in working it out.&#34;<br /><br />I can honestly say reading Underneath it all was hard going. The emotions that spilled from the pages tore me up. I had to walk away numerous times just to take a breath before going back in. It's a book, well a series that will stay with you.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"A Delightful Book!: When I first heard about this book, I thought it seemed like a cute plot in many ways.  The main character, Charlotte Beck, is an eighteen year old American girl who lives life to the fullest. While she is expected to fit into the proper culture of England, she does not succeed very well. Antics and mishaps seem to follow her everywhere she goes.  Many of these mishaps involve English astronomer, Alex Hambly. While the two do not get along, there is also an attraction present.<br /><br />After being upset about Charlotte's behavior and wanting her to start taking life more seriously, Charlotte's father, a very influential business man, offers the two a deal which, in essence, will give both of them what they want. Charlotte will get to go to college so she can help with her family's business, and Alex, who is a viscount, will have money to prevent his well-known family from facing impending financial disaster.  After a four year engagement, they need to fulfill their agreement and marry each other.<br /><br /> Not having seen each other during their four year betrothal,  Charlotte and Alex are expected to wed due to the contract they signed with Charlotte's father years ago.  So, after four years, they meet again.  I found the transition from a young Charlotte to a college-educated Charlotte to be authentic and also very interesting.  Some of her old character is still there, but she is definitely more polished.<br /><br /> I've read some other reviews on this book recently that said it made light of the commitment of marriage.  However, in other time periods, marriage was often a business deal.  It is true that the couple does discuss getting out of the arrangement. However, I think in many ways Alex Hambly's character redeems the whole ordeal by deciding that his commitment made on his wedding day was something serious.  Alex decides that he wants to be a man of his word, especially since their marriage vows were made before the Lord.  I also cannot fault the father entirely, as any reader has to wonder if he saw ahead to the future and was able to discern what he thought was best for his daughter after all.  Alex does what he can to make the inconvenient and seemingly doomed marriage work.  Unfortunately, Charlotte does not feel quite the same...or does she?<br /><br />This was a difficult book to put down.  I definitely recommend it.  I personally am planning on reading more books by this author.  She is an adept writer and skillfully adds in surprises, which is refreshing.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

After installation I noticed that bezel cover isn't accurately sized for the Galaxy watch 3 as stated, it's most noticeable in my third photo. There is no way to actually center the bezel cover so that it aligns with the watch bezel.

"Subpar: I read all of the glowing reviews on here for this item and immediately purchased this gluten-free Honey Nut Chex cereal.  When I poured some in my bowl for the first time, what came out looked exactly like that cereal 'Life'.  The pieces were almost completely flat, which is very uncharacteristic of the other (amazingly delicious) gluten-free chex cereal flavors.  Perhaps I got a bad batch?  More importantly, the flavor of this cereal is bland at most.  I don't seek out outrageously sweet cereals or anything like that.  This was just 'blah' and completely caught me off-guard because I was expecting something epic based upon the glowing reviews.  When it comes down to it, there isn't anything wrong with Honey Nut Chex, per say... it is just nothing special.  I admittedly do feel badly for not giving gluten-free products full marks as I think I should be grateful that companies even make celiac-friendly foods.  The fact remains that as more and more genuinely delicious gluten-free foods appear on the market, it should be okay to admit which, among the many, stand out above the rest.  Honey Nut Chex does not.  The chocolate or cinnamon Chex flavors are FAR more appealing in my opinion.",3.0,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,0,14

It is safely put in the box.  It was easy to set the combination and installed with two screws that you cannot get to while the box is locked.  It is also great when you inadvertently lock yourself out of the house.  There is no more worry about having to leave a key in a location where it can be easily found by someone trying to rob your house.  Admitted, a thief can still break a window, but I would rather be telling my insurance company that my spare key was in a lock box, not under a door mat and that was why the thief had to break a window to enter the house.  The lock box can hold up to 5 keys, so you can also put a spare car key in the box, just in the event that you lock your keys in your car.  It is definitely less expensive than a locksmith.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"Not worth the reading!!!: Simply put the book has no valuable content at all. Once you get pass the Head First presentation format, which I liked before. But for this book it is just an excuse to filling page with irrelevant chit chat. The book also use Java to demonstrate examples. Unfortunately, too much Java, you will find many exercises where you fill-in the blanks in Java code. This book should be about analysis and design, not about coding. The book does mention some important concepts, but does not explain them at all. Many inaccuracies and misleading information make this book useless. Regardless of your level I would not recommend this book for anyone. After reading over 400 pages, I simply decided to stop wasting my time. There is absolutely nothing to be gained from that book.

"4.5 Stars - Great Set of Balls - but questionable storage.: Great Set of Balls! Ordered the regulation size set with the Blue & Red balls - really didn't want Green ones. The price was reasonable compared to other sets and had good reviews. Really happy with the quality of the balls.<br /><br />Now for the carry case - which is rectangular for the set I ordered - with a single layer (2 by 4) of balls (not stacked in square case). Another desired feature for us for ease of storage in our RV compartment. I should have paid closer attention to the picture of the product and read a couple more reviews. The product picture with the case open is accurate - you just don't realize anything is missing/needed. As indicated by others - the case is not rigid, therefore the balls don't stay in place & cluster together when lifted/moved. If you keep the cardboard box the balls came packed in (inside the case), that will work short-term. Eventually the cardboard will fail...unless you treat it like an heirloom instead of an outside game. We will be fabricating our own slotted box to go in the case for permanent use...similar to old-school milk-bottle crates.  If I had realized the case issue before purchase, I may have kept looking for something that didn't need us to ""fix it"".<br /><br />That being said - we are happy overall with the product. Fortunately my husband is handy and can easily fabricate something that will work better for us long term - using scrap material we already have (no extra $). You may not be as handy or want to deal with it. Perhaps in the future the maker of this product will include a practical, long-term use insert that holds everything in place.",5.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Great Value: For the price, these sound great and are comfortable.  I can wear them for hours without problems.  The bass is surprisingly decent for those few songs that need it.  I like the open ear design for use at work as I can hear when people are talking to me.  The whole package is much smaller than it seems in the pictures with the ear pads just barely covering my ears.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is with the portability, or rather the compromises made for that portability.  They fold up decently small and very easily.  This ease means that all adjustments that you make are immediately reset when you take the headphones off your head, even for a second.  Since I use these at work, I just keep them at my desk and don't need them to fold up.  I'd rather that they didn't so I could adjust them exactly how I want and never have to bother again.<br /><br />EDIT October 2013: I've had these since July 2011 and they still sound great, but I have run into a few issues.<br />-They tend to unfold in my bag if I take them with me.  Not a big deal, but it tends to tangle the cord when that happens.<br />-The plastic pieces that hold the two halves of the metal headband together started to unsnap and fall apart.  It was annoying to keep putting them back together, but some superglue has fixed the problem.<br />-After 1.5 years, the cushions have fallen apart.  They're pretty thin to begin with, so no real surprise, and replacements are under $5 for three pairs, but kind annoying.<br /><br />Still, I'd buy another pair if I had to.  Maybe a non-portable version.<br /><br />EDIT March 2016: After 4.5 years, the wire is starting to short out right at the plug (which is what usually kills all the headphones that I own).  They lasted a long time, but most of that time they've just been sitting on my desk and not been carried around in my bag or plugged into my phone as I'm walking.  I haven't exactly been difficult on the plug.  Debating if I should replace them with another pair or get something new.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Was it really all that bad?: I seem to find myself in the minority here, but I actually liked ""Year One"".  Having seen it in the theater, I thought it was a fairly fun and light-hearted experience all around.  The humor is perhaps not as broad as some prefer-but myself, I sort of enjoyed the subtleties.  These type of films usually benefit from a second or even third viewing if you give them a chance.<br /><br />In ""Year One"", Jack Black plays his part adequately but seems to yield the majority of the spotlight to his on-screen cohort Michael Cera.  Michael Cera is the real star of ""Year One"" and Black seems to know it-taking a step back for the younger comedic actor to really shine.  Cera's comedic delivery is dry and spot-on for his character ""Oh"" and he plays the part with real charismatic charm.  In short, it is Cera's film, not Black's-and I wouldn't have had it any other way.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, Year One is just a harmless little diversionary film which doesn't take itself too seriously and nor should you.  I personally thought it had a lot of wit and charm.  Perhaps it just didn't strike the majority of audiences in the same way.  That's too bad too because personally, I found this film far more entertaining than some of the summer's bloated special effects films.<br /><br />Surprisingly, this film looks amazing on Blu-Ray too-especially the city scenes.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"More Trouble Than Its Worth: Beat Saber Handles…What an interesting concept.  By definition, virtual reality is intended to simulate reality.  Beat Saber Handles presumably enhance the heft of the controllers giving them a more “saberlike” feel.  My experience was less than desired.<br /><br />I began by attempting to install the OOAVR Beat Saber Handles onto my Meta Quest controllers.<br /><br />Problem 01: I like to use grips on my Oculus controllers.  Grips are compatible with any app or game and give enhanced security and control for fitness and sports apps.  Normally I would only remove the grips to replace the controller battery.  Since I have found that controller batteries last a month or more, I rarely need to remove the grips, but the grips do need to be removed in order to install the OOAVR Beat Saber Handles.<br /><br />The OOAVR Beat Saber Handles come with custom Velcro loops to secure the handles to the controllers.<br /><br />Problem 02:  I struggled to understand how these Velcro straps were supposed to be implemented despite the fact that I consulted the enclosed illustrated instructions as well as promotional images.  The instructions indicate “If you don’t know how to install it, please see the installation video at the product link, thanks!”  However, there is no QR code for the referenced video link.  There is no OOAVR website.  The only information that I could find was the Amazon listing.  The video at the Amazon listing is promotional not instructional.  So, the enclosed instruction sheet references a non-existent instructional link.<br /><br />Despite these obstacles I managed to install the OOAVR Beat Saber Handles.  I found it awkward and difficult to work with the enclosed customed designed Velcro straps which have to be threaded through a slot on the OOAVR handle.  The straps themselves incorporate a slot opening (they are not just plain old off the shelf Velcro straps).  The Velcro kept sticking to itself.  It took over 5 minutes each to get it set up securely.  It was equally awkward and difficult to remove the Velcro from the slots.  This process would have to be repeated every time that the handles are installed or removed from the controllers.  What a pain!<br /><br />I brought my Oculus to a weeklong annual family get together.  Seven adults were in attendance.  The Oculus and Beat Saber were big hits.  I had everyone try the OOAVR Beat Saber Handles and I solicited opinions.  Some users liked them and appreciated the extra heft.  Some users preferred the grips.  Of those that liked the OOAVR Beat Saber Handles, none were bowled over with enthusiasm.  One user felt that she was less accurate with the OOAVR Handles installed.  Another user felt that there was no difference in accuracy.  I hit a physical obstacle that was just outside of my Guardian because of the increased reach with the handles installed.<br /><br />Next we tried the OOAVR Beat Saber Handles on other apps including Synth Rider and Miniature Golf.  The handles did not seem to be of much advantage with Synth Rider but they were favored for Miniature Golf.<br /><br />The controllers cannot be fitted into a storage/carrying case with the OOAVR Beat Saber Handles installed.  So, the handles would have to be constantly installed and removed for storage, transport and use of apps and games where they are not needed.<br /><br />I believe that the OOAVR Beat Saber Handles would be most appreciated by someone who primarily uses Beat Saber and (almost) never uses a carrying case.  I appreciate the concept of enhancing the virtual reality experience.  I would not be surprised if an array of specialized devices are developed in the future that enhance the virtual reality experience.  I do believe that the end user will prefer enhancements that are more user friendly than this offering.  Finally, the supplied Velcro is problematic.  The loop opening in the Velcro would be difficult to replicate if the supplied strap should become lost or damaged.  These handles would not be safe to use without a secure attachment to the controllers.<br /><br />To Summarize: The OOAVR Beat Saber Handles have poorly illustrated instructions, lack an instruction video, are troublesome to install, are difficult to remove, depend on specialized Velcro straps, are useless if the specialized Velcro straps are lost or broken, are incompatible with storage cases and afford minimally enhanced virtual reality experience when playing Beat Saber.",2.0,Video_Games,0,33

"Shiatsu back and neck massager: I am very pleased with my purchase.  I am 5'4"" so I did need to sit on a pillow for the lowest setting on the neck module to properly massage my neck, but that does not at all take away from the effects of my massage.  I can still feel the seat vibration, even sitting on a pillow.  The full back massage feels perfect... not too soft, nor does it hurt.  I had previously bought a different brand, which I sent back, because the full back massage was very uncomfortable.  With the other brand, the upper back nodules dug into my back, but this massager feels great during upper and lower back massage modes.  I especially like the tapping mode.  I also felt the back nodules contoured perfectly with my back curvature.  The only area that I feel is lacking, is the massager not providing heat to the neck area... and the heat that it does provide to the back really is not hot enough.  It definitely could stand to get hotter.  Overall, I feel, for the price, this is a great back and neck massager, and I would definitely recommend it.",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

Would totally recommend this to pet owners who have the same problems we do!",5.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26
"Overall, it's a good purchase: The packaging is not great. There is no insert sheet to tell you which episodes are on which discs. Instead we get small printing on each disc listing the episodes (which have all been renamed) but at least they are all in the proper order. All 4 discs are held on one spindle on one side of the case. They are free to spin on top of each other. It's fine if you leave it on the shelf, but I wouldn't transport it anywhere in this case.<br /><br />The episodes don't appear to have been remastered in any way. The audio and video look the same as it did when I was young. The video is scratchy, and at several points there is a low hum in the audio line. You can watch it in Japanese with English Subtitles, or you can turn on the English audio track.<br /><br />The last disc has a 23 minute interview with the American voice cast. It seems to be recorded with a 1980's handheld camcorder. Shaky and bad quality but it's really nice to see it if you're a fan. The fact that they even added it tells you they cared about the product. It also has the American intro as a separate file. (The intro that plays with each episode is the original version.)<br /><br />Overall, it's a good purchase and I don't regret buying it. Personally I think the audio/video imperfections make it a little better.<br /><br />Note: I converted each episode to an MP4 file and loaded them into my Plex Media Server so I can watch them on my TVs, phones, tablets, PCs, and laptops whenever/wherever I want. If you do something like this (or if you backup your discs to ISO files incase they get scratched) it's good to know that the data label for each disc is: ULTRAMAN_DISC1, Disc 2, ULTRAMAN_DISC3, ULTRAMAN_DISC4. The second disc was mislabeled at the factory.",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

While $30 is higher than what seems to be higher than the average for this type of product, this certainly adheres to the time old adage: you get what you pay for. I frequently take the iPad in and out of the spring loaded arms, and it features a sturdy but not aggressive spring--which I presume will last a while.<br /><br />The only point where this loses a star is that it adds a significant bulk to your device, this is a trade-off that gives you better leverage--but compared to several other straps that do not feature plastic it adds weight and size.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Stove Caught on Fire and Burned Up (Do not recommend :)): I used it maybe six times and this morning the pump will not pump anymore. The instructions on the Coleman website are no help. It's past the return date......this $70 dollar stove appears to be toast...and its too late to return it to Amazon.<br /><br />This is the 3rd Coleman product I've tried in the last 3 months that's fallen apart; a tent pole that hit the ground and fell apart ended their 4-person tent, their easy-lighter firestick for the stove worked about 5 times and then quit, and now, here I am out in Utah with a busted stove and a cooler full of meat that's going to go bad. Even if Coleman replaces whatever went wrong - there's no way to get it to me...<br /><br />So - Coleman the company and the stove - gets a big zero from me....I've learned my lesson; I'm staying away from their products from here on in.<br /><br />Update -a month later.<br /><br />Replacing the pump ($10) fixed the problem. To their credit Coleman agreed to replace the stove, but since the new pump fixed the problem I kept it. (They did not offer to pay for the new  pump.)<br /><br />Replacing the pump, though, was kind of emblematic of my entire experience with Coleman. The pump kit provided the pump, a ring and a spring and some other stuff. The instructions said to take the bottom off the pump,which I dully did - not an easy procedure and then put the ring and spring on. It noted as I remember that pump would not work without the spring.<br /><br />I had to buy some needlenose pliers to get the pump bottom off. I had also had to buy some pliers to remove the pump from the stove...(Another $15).  I couldn't figure to put the spring and the ring - so  I gave up in frustration.<br /><br />I went to the Coleman website - but the instructions were the same. Finally I looked it up on the web and found out that the spring and ring only apply to EARLIER models. All you do is replace the pump in the later models - but Coleman somehow doesn't believe it should tell you that in its instructions on the  pump kit; they tell you to replace the ring and spring. (I imagined that they had just fallen off and that was why the pump wasn't working).<br /><br />Anyway, for three weeks the stove works fine. Then I start it up one  day and a flame appears around from where the attachment from the gas canister attaches to the body of the stove.  The burner, however, is not lighting.<br /><br />Twice I turn the stove off - reduce the amount of fuel in it - and try again and the same thing happens. I turn off the stove  and watch the flame GROW....Soon the burner is indeed lit but so are the areas leading the burner. Worried that fuel is leaking from the canister into the stove (even with the stove off) I remove the canister and watch as the flame grows until its shooting probably two feet in the air.<br /><br />I close the lid in  order to douse the flame and it simply shoots out the sides of stove - a good foot in a half - and burns for a good ten minutes and then its out. In the last couple of minutes I take a couple of pictures.<br /><br />Now I have a new incident :) so I provide Coleman with the picture to demonstrate what happened and the Amazon.com receipt to start the process of getting the stove replaced. Coleman requires that I also provide an address and to take pictures of the stove with the serial number written  on  it.<br /><br />That's the next step I will take but Coleman to their credit immediately, sends out another stove. The problem is that they sent it out to my old address and I'm 1100 miles away.<br /><br />When I tell them that I'm not at that address and  that I never provided by current address - as requested by Coleman - and they sent it out too  quickly -  they tell me to contact UPS and  change it. (???) It took several emails for them to get that since I did not send out  the product,I certainly couldn't change the address on  it.<br /><br />Finally they contacted UPS and  were informed  that it would take a fee to change the  address. At that point they refused to do anything else with the stove unless UPS delivered the stove back to them. Since no one's living at that address that I know of I would be surprised if  the stove ever makes it back.<br /><br />My three weeks with the Coleman stove cost $70 for the stove, $20 of meat I  never ate because the stove wasn't functioning, two pairs of pliers ($15) and one replacement pump kit ($10)...$115<br /><br />I wouldn't trust Coleman and their products as far as I could throw them at this point.<br /><br />It's too bad - I used their backpacking stove for years; it was the most reliable stove I found and I figured the same would be true of this stove but no....I guess its a different company now.",1.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,0,28

"Quality has changed: I got one of these huts over 2 years ago and it's just now getting to the point where it needs to be replaced so I was expecting another high quality product. For one, the side walls are now unfinished wood, which is fine and honestly probably safer for guinea pigs to chew. But I ordered one of the ones with the fixed top, like I had before, and it was pretty dirty on the top and it had a large area on the side where glue had dripped all the way from the roof down to the bottom and dried. That is definitely not safe for the guinea pigs if they were to chew that area. I assumed it was a fluke so I asked for a replacement but the second one had the exact same problem and actually was an even bigger drip area. Not sure if this is a production issue or a quality control issue or what but it definitely has discouraged me from getting another.",3.0,Pet_Supplies,0,26

"Fast drive, small size.. but DIED after 3 months, like previous one.: This is the second Corsair Voyager drive I bought.<br /><br />The first was a 32 USB 2.0, which, I found once it died that that model was prone to a early death.<br /><br />Corsair was fast about replacing it, and the replacement is used once in a while but sits on my desk for fear that putting it in my pocket would lead to it's death.<br /><br />I figured that this being a newer model, a USB 3.0, that Corsair would have fixed this issue with their drives.<br /><br />I was hoping that they would have done something about having just the chip board in the rubber shell, but it appears that they still haven't added a hard shell underneath the rubber/silicone, making the drive prone to stress.  But the smaller size should assist in making the drive more durable.<br /><br />Well, I learned yesterday that I was wrong when my drive was dead upon connecting it.  It ask to reformat it, which I tried, but it doesn't stop asking to reformat it (and give exFAT as only option), then shows it's capacity as 78KB, then hangs.<br /><br />While it worked, it was great.  Very fast and everything I was hoping for in a USB 3.0 drive.<br /><br />But as I have other Jump drives that are several years old, a 512MB that I use at work on a constant basis... there's no drive that I have that gets as much read and write as this drive and it's still working great after so many thousands of uses, and never even once an issue with it, it just gives a comparison of what a jump drive should be like.<br /><br />I do not believe that I will ever buy another Corsair drive after this, which is sad, as they are very fast drives, but reliability is too important to sacrifice.",2.0,Electronics,0,12

"Easier than traditional wallpaper, but still a little tricky: I acquired a dresser with decoupaged dresser drawers that I wanted to re-do. I decided this peel and stick wallpaper would be a simple fix for my dresser drawers. It was relatively simple, but the hardest part of using it on furniture is getting a NEAT and PRECISE cut. So, be prepared to break out a yard stick, level, measuring tape, and quality scissors before taking on this type of a project with the paper. Using it the way I did didn't require trying to align the print in a way that actually papering a wall would do. I think there would be some loss of material if you need to cut off a portion to get it to line up correctly with the other side. This roll of paper would literally only make two stripes on a normal height wall. So it will take many rolls to complete a wall. Once applied it does stay in place well, and pulls off easily, if done quickly. I'm not sure how it will pull off months or years from now, though.",3.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,0,30

"Possibly the worst children's book ever made: While it may lose that crown of shame to the Tormont edition of [[ASIN:2894295057 The Brave Little Tailor]], this awful rendering of Hugh Lofting's Doctor Dolittle is nevertheless sure to disappoint on every level.<br /><br />The adaption by Al Perkins? Dumb-talk for children, with a confusing message to boot. The book starts with a cliche: ""Once upon a time, there was a doctor"" and it's all downhill from there. The second sentence insults the intelligence of any reader, regardless of age: ""The M.D. meant that he was a doctor and that he knew a lot."" (!) Upon Dr. Dolittle's arrival in Africa, readers are exposed to one of the worst misrepresentations ever seen in a children's book: ""The Doctor found hundreds and thousands of very sick monkeys. He made all the monkeys come to be vaccinated [Three days later] Doctor Dolittle saw that none of the monkeys were sick any more. They were all well! His vaccinations had cured them all."" I am fairly certain that even in 1920, vaccinations provided immunity against future disease rather than curing an existing ailment. The illustrations by Philip Wende? Creepy. The monkeys look like aliens or possibly Australopithecus.<br /><br />Compared to modern children's literature, the message here is heavy-handed and politically incorrect. The African savages are violent and dumb. The King sleeps in a bed decorated with skulls. Fearful of the unknown, he imprisons Dr. Dolittle as a medicine-man along with his band of animals. Even more fearful of being cursed--with mumps, no less! Who subsidized this printing, the CDC?--the king is tricked into freeing them. Score one for the colonial powers! The story in its original form, like those featuring that other simian Curious George, will set off a modern PC Geiger counter. And this version doesn't even include the infamous white-face incident from the original Story of Doctor Dolittle! Finally, and just like the Man with the Yellow Hat, Dr. Dolittle brings home a souvenir from the old country in the form of a live pet.<br /><br />In summary, even if you like the original story in all its early 20th century glory, this version will disappoint. Everyone else will be disgusted straightaway. Worst of all, this book (as published in 1967) carries the Random House seal of approval in the form of the Cat in the Hat-emblazoned ""Beginner Books"" imprint, leading some to believe this book might have been worth having. It wasn't then and it isn't now.<br /><br />[Hugh Lofting's Travels of Doctor Dolittle (Adapted for Beginning Readers) is inexplicably offered in at least four Product Listings here on Amazon. Please excuse the cross-post until Amazon hopefully cleans this up.]<br /><br />P.S. to Amazon: The correct spelling is Dolittle (one ""o"").",1.0,Books,0,7

"Sleek, Modern, Functional!: The packaging was very nice - felt very high end for the price. The main mechanism holds the cards nice and tight and the push lever works very well. I tested the lever about 40 times, it worked every single time without catching. I could fit up to 6 cards in the wallet but I noticed the wallet functioned best with 4 cards in it, so that’s what I would recommend. The metal finish of the wallet is very smooth and very high end looking. I really like the overall look of the wallet a lot!<br /><br />I like the pocket on the outside of the wallet, but it could be a little more snug (I use it to hold business cards which might be a little too small for this design). I like the extra pocket that comes with this gift set too - gives me the option to add to the other side of the wallet or use it somewhere else.<br /><br />If I had to call out some cons for this wallet: the push mechanism is made of plastic and sticks out just a little too far - my biggest concern is it’ll catch my pocket when I’m not paying attention or damage my phone (which I currently carry in the same pocket). The wallet, being metal, is also heavier than the wallet I’m used to carrying - not a fault of this wallet but just something I’ll have to get used to!",4.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

It's when I noticed why buttom was open because either warehouse employees carelessly dragged it or driver did because a screw insert on chairs base was damaged, the type of damage that can only exist when metal is dragged on concrete.

The toe caps are a little on the snug side and with wide my wide feet I can feel it just a bit but the material used to make these flexes really well and I dont see any issues in the future. I normally wear a 10 but had to get a 9.5 just as I do in the FJ so they run about 1/2 size big.  They do make a bit of noise when walking on hard surfaces but who really cares?  They wont make a sound walking thru grass.  I do expect them to make an imprint on the greens but any brand new spike is going to do the same thing...Dont worry, the grass will grow back!  They use the same type of cleat as the M Projects so replacements wont be hard to find if I lose one.  Overall a great looking/feeling shoe.

"Deserving of its place in the stars!: John Williams, long-time composer and most notably for Steven Spielberg and Star Wars creator George Lucas, has taken his talents to another high in the scoring of The Phantom Menace.  Williams, in his legendary musical genius has beautifully sculpted the score to play seemlessly with George  Lucas' stunning vision.  Since Lucas stresses that his movies could easily  be viewed without dialogue and sound effects, it makes the score all that  more important.  And Williams has done a spectacular job on all four  outings.<br />Williams takes basic elements from his original trilogy score  and blends them gorgeously with his new elements.  Though few and far  between, these remaining elements help to bridge the obvious (and remaining  for a few more years) gap between the first and fourth episodes in the Star  Wars saga.  He magically incorporates the force theme, as well as  &quot;hiding&quot; the Imperial March in Anakin's Theme.  A few significant  bars of the menacing March are fantastically blended into the &quot;young  and innocent&quot; theme of the young Skywalker.<br />Quite possibly the  greatest achievement on this project, however, is the song &quot;Duel of  the Fates.&quot; He has taken a hauntingly and grandiose piece and given it  a sharp edge that brilliantly illustrates the movie's turn.  In addition  his playing with the driving vocals and timpani make it all the more  exciting.",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"poetic inspiration v. priestly vocation: ""This is a work of fiction based on fact,"" writes novelist Ron Hansen. On December 6, 1875 the passenger ship Deutschland ran aground on a sandbar in the mouth of the Thames River. Before its rescue the following day, 157 people died of exposure to the frigid waters and blizzard conditions. Among those who perished were five Franciscan nuns from Germany who were traveling to Missouri via New York City. The young Jesuit seminarian Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844-1889) was so moved by the tragedy that he memorialized the event in a 35-stanza poem called The Wreck of the Deutschland. In alternating chapters Hansen tells the stories of the nuns who died and the poet who commemorated them.<br /><br />  Very little is known about the five nuns, except that they were expelled from Germany because of Bismarck's anti-Catholic measures. They were exiles in the literal sense of the word, but also in the figurative sense of having left their homes and families for the cause of Christ. Like many exiles, they met a tragic end. Much more is known about Hopkins, the oldest of nine children who, under the influence of the famous Cardinal John Henry Newman, converted to Catholicism in 1866. And as if this was not enough to embitter his parents, he chose the Jesuits. Eleven years later his mother and father refused to attend his ordination to the priesthood.<br /><br />  Hopkins was not only ""exiled"" by his parents but also by the larger Anglican world at Oxford. An eccentric and over scrupulous man plagued by ""black moods,"" Hopkins was also alienated from his own self. He abandoned poetry to pursue the priesthood, and even burned much of his early verse. The secular pursuit of poetry was no match for the spiritual vocation of a priesthood. Or was it? Hopkins remained deeply conflicted about this throughout his life. Close to his death, he made his confession, which included his regret for ""shutting off the grace of inspiration by not paying enough attention to his poetic gift"" (202). Hopkins was further exiled when he was sent by the Jesuits to Ireland, and also because of his highly experimental and complicated poetic style called ""sprung rhythm,"" which was little understood or appreciated by his close friends and colleagues.<br /><br />  The famous shipwreck seemed to provoke Hopkins to a time of poetic creativity after a period of silence. Otherwise, these are two stories that proceed along parallel tracks that don't intersect, except for the broader themes of exile and fate. Hopkins was left to brood over the tragic fate of the five nuns, and over his own life which, as put it, was kicked around like ""Fortune's football."" Ultimately, Hopkins, the nuns, and all of us are exiles, ""not from Germany, not from Europe, but from Paradise, from Heaven"" (192).",3.0,Books,0,7

Not only is this different, but the entire front buckle has to be shoved rather hard to get it to close completely on the adjustable part of the belt.  Part of this problem is the very stiff fabric.  I even soaked it in water overnight hoping that would soften it up.  Still stiff and difficult to manipulate.  I do not recommend this belt.

"The Butterfly Effect by Andy Andrews: The Butterfly Effect is a gift book about the power of actions and how each person can make a difference in the world. The book begins by recounting a chain of events that helped the Union win the Civil War. Next, the book narrates about individuals who helped to prevent a famine. The overarching theme of the book is that each of our actions affect others, and we never know which step will change the world. It is an encouragement for us to live with passion and purpose.<br /><br />The message of this short book is presented in a clear and captivating manner, keeping the reader engaged to find out where the story is going. The pages are beautifully illustrated. Though God is never mentioned by name, the message about His plan for each human life is strongly implied. In the author's note, Andrews says that when we live lives of purpose every result of our actions improve. I'm not convinced this is true, and I wish the focus had been a little less on what we can gain and more on the joy of helping others. But overall, the message of The Butterfly Effect was inspiring. I think it would make a great graduation gift.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the [...] book review bloggers program.

"Night Watch: Kendra Michaels had been born blind and for her first twenty years of her life her other senses became overly developed as a way for her to adapt without her sight. When a revolutionary medical procedure developed by England’s Night Watch Project became available to Kendra she finds herself being able to see for the first time in her life. Kendra with her newfound site began to work with law enforcement as a consultant with the help of her overly developed senses along with her new found sight.<br /><br />Kendra receives a visit from Dr. Charles Waldridge who had been the one that returned Kendra's sight and she didn't think everything was well with him. That very night though the doctor that Kendra feels she owes everything to has come up missing so Kendra is determined to do whatever she can to find him before it's to late. Making contact with those she's worked with before Kendra jumps right into the investigation and won't give up until she knows what happened.<br /><br />Night Watch is the fourth book in the Kendra Michaels series by Iris Johansen. This however is the first of this series I've read so I was jumping in a bit blind myself as to what had gone on in the first three books. I think for the most part this one read fine as a standalone with the exception of possibly some background information on the characters. There are things mentioned here and there that I wasn't sure if it had happened in previous books or was new information to the story but overall the author does a good job of catching the reader up on the series and characters making the read enjoyable.<br /><br />This particular book in the series was full of the action that I have come to expect from an Iris Johansen story. Kendra is a strong, determined female lead that while she often seems a bit quirky she was extremely likable and fun to follow as she tried to solve the case. I don't know what the previous books focused on but this one seemed to really drive Kendra to solve the case with her personal involvement with Dr. Waldridge.<br /><br />Overall, another really solid read from Iris Johansen, action packed and intense all the way through.<br /><br />I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.",4.0,Books,1,7

"A master effort on par with Jaco: This album will blow you away.  There has been a lot written about Matt, just Google it, and it is true he is the &#34;new Jaco&#34;.<br />The harmonic, melodic, and technical aspects (and musicality) of this album is on-par with Jaco's self-titled album, and I don't throw that term around lightly.<br />It's unfortunate that so many bassists have copied his style, phrasing, technique, and approach without giving so much as a nod towards Matt in interviews of their influences.  If you study and look back at who was doing this sort of thing in the early 2000s, there weren't many bassists who were approaching their solo albums with this ferocity.  Now, it seems there are a dime a dozen stringing their 5-strings with a high C, installing ramps and playing with their 2+ fingers curled under using their fingertips to pluck, playing extended chords and using melodic minor scales heavily overtop of changes.  This isn't a bad thing, some of these copy artists are legitimate in their own right.  But, it just shows the influence that Matt has had on the world of bass, similarly to how Jaco changed the electric bass for everyone.<br />Matt is a true artist. I just wish more people would notice!",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Typical fare, with inaccuracies, as I was there.: This tome suffers the same shortcomings most all the other third-party ""insights"" do: they were not there. I was. I worked for and traveled with the band throughout Hotel California and into The Long Run, as well as shared a house with Glenn in Colorado, and even played in the famous Eagles vs Rolling Stone softball game.  Like most of the media's insights, it lacks accuracy in varying degrees (from slight to outrageous).<br />Additionally,  multiple reviewers claim that the ""real story"" resides in Felder's book are somewhat mistaken.  Having been an eye witness to many of the occurrences often referred to in his book as well as others, I can attest that these portrayals are highly tinted with generous doses of personal biases to outright fabrications. It might make for more interesting reading about Eagles ""dirty laundry "", but the reports are sometimes rather far afield of actual facts.<br />Alais, facts don't sell books or make headlines; sensational claims do, no matter how much of a stranger to the truth they might be.<br />The behind the scenes truth is the guys in the band were/are actually really decent individuals.  People I'm pleased to call friends.  Not without faults mind you (like all of us) and sometimes a bit full of themselves, but certainly not the totally self-absorbed narcissists they're all too commonly referenced as.<br />But as a collection of talented musicians and eclectic individuals,  the nexus resulted in some memorable music that has left its mark on history.<br />FYI, Ben started out disliking the Eagles, but after getting to know them he became a fan.",3.0,Books,0,7

"She explained to me that she loved the book so much after first discovering it back ...: Bought this for my wife of nearly forty years.  She's been an avid canner and pickler for many years.  She recently mentioned that she had somehow managed to lose her 'Pickling Bible' (this book) and was really mourning the loss.  She explained to me that she loved the book so much after first discovering it back in the 70's in our local library that, after learning the book was out of print she fibbed to the library about losing it - in order to keep the copy.  The library was compensated of course.  But now, decades later, she was certain that finding another copy would be impossible.<br /><br />Enter Amazon and it's used book suppliers!!  Suffice it to say that when the book arrived and I presented it to her she was beside herself with happiness.<br /><br />Take it from me - if my canning and pickling expert wife thinks this book is a virtual canner's bible?

"Bicycle Research CT-4, Shimano Splined Freewheel Remover (pre-1985): This is the Bicycle Research CT-4, also known as the Shimano Splined Freewheel Remover (pre-1985).  It sells for $5.95 at BicycleTool but I decided to make the purchase here on Amazon because of how it looks.  This freewheel remover tool looks better and is more sturdy compared to the pictures of the Bicycle Research CT-4 at BicycleTool.  This remover tool has 12 teeth and is measured at 20mm in diameter.  I have a classic Schwinn Le Tour and I was able to remove the freewheel off of it.  I didn't know that the Park Tools FR-1 won't fit.  I originally bought the FR-1 to do the job, but turns out the FR-1 was slightly larger that what I needed it for.  I like this remover tool, but I don't like the price.  It is expensive at $15.25.  But here's the thing, without this tool, I wouldn't be able to remove the flywheel.  It is hard to search for this tool on Amazon.  I would recommend the seller to rename it to something else so that people can find them easier.  ""Shimano Splined Freewheel Remover (pre-1985)"" perhaps.",5.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Lord of Temptation: Overall, I thought this book was very good. The entire Lost Lords of Pembrooke theme is an interesting one. It makes your heartache for them as kids and helps to paint the picture of their background stories.  I liked the first book, and can't wait for the final book.  This book had me turning pages and staying awake when I should been asleep. Always the mark of a good book!<br /><br />I won't go into to every detail about the book, just my opinion on a few things.<br /><br />First, I really liked the characters and the storyline. I really dislike books we the couple spends 80% of the book arguing, since this wasn't the case I didn't have to worry about that.  It moved along at a good pace and kept me very interested.  But, I did think there were some parts where the language was too modern. At one point, her maid says &#34;Ew&#34; which seems out of place.  It was very moving as a love story but I couldn't help thinking that their relationship was more about attraction that emotions.<br />Spoilers*******<br /> Part of what I found nteresting was the amount of things keeping them apart. I kept thinking there is no good way to overcome all of this. But, miraculously everything works out well, maybe just a little well, a little too easy. All of the problems from the majority of the book were solved in two pages.  I kept thinking, her family s going to need a reason to change their minds. Maybe some situation or action on his part will show him in a new light. But no, they just said &#34;are you sure...ok that's good enough for me&#34;<br />Still I liked it very much, enough to give it 4 stars.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Matched my Old Town Canoe!: I recently bought a green Old Town Camper 15 canoe that was a demo at a shop in NH.  It looked great.  When we got it home, we dragged it down to the water and turned it over only to discover that we had scraped a patch of the vinyl skin off down to the core, or that we just hadn't looked at the bottom in the shop and someone else had done that.  In any event, finding the right color vinyl paint to fix it was not easy---the one place online that purported to have a match for the Old Town canoe actually was out of that color.  So i took a chance on this, and yesterday sprayed two coats onto the bottom of the canoe.  You cannot tell I did so, the match is so good. So if your canoe needs sprucing up (or hunter greening up) this is the way to go.  The paint went on easily and has an effective spray head.  Dried quickly.  If it falls right off in the water I'll revise this review.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"What a relief!: I broke my ankle and was discharged after surgery with a walker and crutches.  Because I can't weight bear on my right foot for 6 weeks. the first week home I needed to hop on one foot while maneuvering the walker.  That caused stress to my good ankle, pain in my back and made my broken ankle hurt worse.  I found it very stressful and strenuous nor did I feel safe.  I ordered this kneel roller and it has made all the difference in the world.  My brother assembled it for me and now I can get around with so much more ease.  Given that greater ease of movement and feeling more stable, it has also helped to calm my nerves about getting around.  I'm 5'2 and the dimensions of this unit meet my needs easily.  I added the basket and plush pad cover for more convenience and comfort.  NO REGRETS!  I would highly recommend this model and think its a great buy for the price.  Update: 4 weeks later...Do not hesitate to buy this kneel roller.  I borrowed a friends knee roller to get around on my second floor.

"Superb grip and comfort: The pistol grip is easily overlooked on an AR platform, but is crucial.

(I like this one, but I couldn't justify $40.<br />The traditional A2 grip.<br /><br />For comfort and grip texture, this was the only choice. It's soft and grippy, but not overly so in either aspect.<br />The grip is difficult to describe. All the other grips were hard, slippery polymer.

"Exceeded My Expectations: Excellent mouse that exceeded my expectations. I use the same mouse for two systems via kvm switch, works great for both gaming and productivity work. I have chosen not to install the driver that allows customization; basic buttons and on-the-fly dpi adjustment is really all I need for the games I play.<br /><br />Excellent rough/grippy texture and shape fits my smallish hands well. My guess is that the mouse is good for anyone with small or medium hands; maybe a tad small for someone with large hands.

"I love this printer!: I ask my wife frequently, &#34;Have I mentioned lately that I love this printer?&#34;<br /><br />I had an HP Somedangthingorother previously that irritated the heck out of my with its inability to do much of anything easily except for print text from our main computer.<br /><br />I bought this hoping for some sort of improvement. Imagine my joy when it does everything it is supposed to do with a great amount of ease! It prints! Quickly! From any of our computers / devices wirelessly! Without losing the connections to said devices!<br /><br />That in itself is fantastic, but it does so much more. I can scan with it, easily. Heck, I can even use the ADF to scan stuff in and it somehow manages to scan in both sides of a paper if asked to do so. I was dubious the first time I went to try it and it worked flawlessly. There are features I haven't even tried yet that I bet work wonderfully, like the card reader...and I haven't tried to print on odd-sized paper, but from everything I've seen so far, I'd be willing to bet it will work just as well. Oh, and while I don't print a ton of things in color, I have not yet changed either of the inks from the ones they sent with the printer.<br /><br />If I had one negative thing to say, it's a software issue. I have been scanning in my old photo albums and saving them offsite with a backup service and it's a bit annoying to have to suffix every scan with 001, 002, etc. Sometimes that can be handy, but the ability to turn off the automatic numbering would be a nice feature.

"Has some drawbacks: I wanted to like this player: it loads quickly, has great streaming (we use Netflix), and is easy to use. However, it has two drawbacks, one minor and one major.<br /><br />The minor drawback is that it makes whirring noises that are audible during the quiet parts of a music CD or between tracks. So I wouldn't recommend this for audiophiles.<br /><br />The major one is that it just freezes up occasionally. This happens about once a month or so, which is the interval that makes it maximally annoying. If it was more frequent I'd just junk the thing, and if it was less frequent it wouldn't bother me much. It also chooses the most inconvenient times, like when we were having a big party and wanted to put a movie on for the kiddies. The unit is on but the TV screen is totally black - no error message or anything. In some cases I am able to eject the DVD, in other cases I couldn't even do that. Unplugging ALL my devices and starting from scratch is the only solution. (One good thing is that the unit remembers my login info for streaming services like Netflix, so I don't have to type it all in every time.) I went through the update protocol and my software is up to date, so I don't know any way to fix this.<br /><br />As far as the streaming, I haven't had any of the problems others mention. The unit has an advantage over our Roku One in that it supports Netflix profiles, so my son can use his own profile and not clog his parents' list with kid videos. I had hoped it would replace our Roku completely, but even though this unit has a good range of popular streaming options, it doesn't offer all the channels that Roku does (e.g. PBS channel, which I watch a lot).<br /><br />Of course, it's cheap, so if you're happy with the streaming options and you're willing to put up with the annoyances, it might still be a good option.",3.0,Electronics,0,12

"***** EYEBALLS & GALAXIES #####: Artwork cheesy? ... THE POWER OF CHEESE! This is what all bands should try to do with the cd artwork. This great package is really FUN and my enjoyment of the band and each release goes up every time (I have all but the first) partly because of their old-school effort to create a mental/visual trip that supports the music, like the great psychedelic albums of the 1960/70's. Not many cds are this DELUXE - Some people are never happy. I doubt they can profit easily after the expense and overall effort that is provided graciously to the fans here.<br /><br />My goodness, this packs a monstrous set of progressive/psychedelic rock balls. What a headtrip generally!  The gradual but beautiful building of energy through each song and to the eventual (75:52 minutes) sci-fi endpoint of the album is like engaging the eyeballs of the universe to get a glimpse of galaxies far away ... DON'T YOU LOVE IT WHEN MUSIC CAN DO THAT?<br /><br />We should accept this fine package for what it is: intense, well-produced/conceived musical artistry that is a pleasure to behold and experience (and a great collectible value as unique visual album art that few bands or record co's would provide at this price).  I am still digesting the album musically, even though I have given it numerous careful (musician) listens. It takes a good long while to explore the nuances of this conceptual infinity knot (song, verse and construction) ... but lyrics would have been helpful considering the thickly layered vocals in parts.<br /><br />My take on this: 10,000 Days is a very cool, unique and special album. Don't rush it, it takes time to absorb for sure. It is a progression of the band taken to new but familiar places (I am intentionally NOT comparing to previous Tool albums, a futile excercise with most great bands; they are all excellent, moody masterpieces). The extra paint on Van Gogh's paintings seemed garish to some fussy people of his day, and Salvador Dali was a little too trippy for most - but we now see them as visionary artists on the cutting edge of their genres (and their oddities endearing).  Aren't we glad they did it their way?  Thank you Tool for going all out to please the fans. Enjoy (late at night)!",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"The Straights are Not Okay: Shadow of the Coalition is the third instalment in the Omni Towers series, a post-apocalyptic dystopia where survival is one hell of a struggle on the Surface, but wealth & Politics rule the Towers. It doesn’t disappoint!<br /><br />Trigger warnings:<br />Death<br />Violence<br />Betrayal<br />Blackmail<br />GBH<br />Survival<br />Love Triangle<br />Ableism<br />Cliffhanger!<br /><br />Characters of Colour?<br />One named character has explicit dark skin, & his role in this book is even tinier than the last two.<br />This change, in particular, is disappointing.<br />Viridian is still brown in my Headcanon, as is Carl. I make no apologies.<br /><br />GLITTFAB/Queer characters?<br />STILL NONE.<br />Instead, we have this awful, awkward love triangle where the two guys are fighting & the poor MC in the middle is getting the short end of the stick but also making everything worse by not allowing that she has feelings for both.<br />Love triangles frustrate me. Not in the good way, either.<br />I can’t give any more details without them being Spoilers, but believe me, the Straights are Not Okay.<br /><br />Disabled characters?<br />Still none. Still a deeply, upsettingly, ableist societal structure. The MC is making moves to crush a few class divides, but there’s still absolutely no room for disability. There’s some upsetting discussion about just how brutal the current system is, about the way lives are lost. Be ready for that.<br /><br />Worth my time?<br />At about 6 hours, I had to split this up into a couple different sections as I got too upset. I have no abiding regrets. The story is getting more complex, but it’s just as compelling. The characters are (mostly) growing - except where the MC has managed to forget all the basic defence she learned less than a hot minute ago.<br />I hope we see more of the Ruin Rats in the next book. They felt like they played second fiddle to the new & shiny Omnis this time around.<br /><br />Re-read?<br />Yeah, there’s absolutely re-read potential here. I can already tell there are details I won’t have noticed this read-through, & this book is colouring my perceptions of the earlier books. It’s absolutely something that has stood up to itself so far!<br /><br />Recommend?<br />This is NOT a Standalone, so anyone who enjoyed the previous books will probably enjoy this!<br /><br />I received this book in exchange for my honest views.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Another Excellent Chapter in the Dragon Quest Series: I won't go into how much of a phenomenon DQ is in Japan, suffice it to say it paved the way for console RPGs, and has become an institution in that country to rival Disney.  Yuji Horii has steered this ship since its beginning in 1986 and continues to innovate while keeping the classic DQ play that fans worldwide expect.  In short, turn-based battles, the foundation of Dragon Quest make a return, as do the requisite monsters such as Slimes.  What has changed though, besides being on a handheld, is the social aspects of the game; local multiplayer, passive mode, and online wi-fi DLC all enter the picture to make this one of the most well-rounded RPGs to come from Japan in ages.  They've even thrown in some casual aspects such as customizing your party and outfits to try to appeal to a larger female audience.  I would say the game suffers slightly by not having well-rounded NPCs to accompany your character, but the focus this time is really on you, and your real life friends, so it's left much more open-ended to create your own adventure.  Even after the campaign is finished, there is tons to do in DQ IX, and hopefully with Square's promise of a year's worth of new dungeons, we will be playing this game for a long time.",5.0,Video_Games,1,33

"Should be Required Listening...: For some reason, Canada seems to have an extraordinary wealth of highly talented musicians, artists and songwriters. Maybe it's those cold winters and the tendency to gather around the kitchen table and trade songs on those cold winter nights. Not sure.<br /><br />James Keelaghan is one of those artists and his body of work is about as good as it gets, with a resonant baritone reminiscent of Stan and Garnet Rogers, and an ability to write great songs, often with an historical perspective, that will make your heart swell. This is the guy who wrote ""Cold MIssouri Waters"", about the Mann Gulch Fire of 1949. One of the most moving songs I've ever heard.<br /><br />Some of these songs are going to become classics. Safe Home is a simple tune but it is one that stays with you after the last note falls silent. McConnville's is a gentle but moving tale of friendship.

"The Craft of Making Great People Decisions: Lesson 1: People Decisions Are Vitally Important to You and Your Organization<br /><br />""If you prove to be skilled at solving ""people puzzles,"" your career prospects will almost certainly get brighter. Conversely, if you repeatedly fail to  get the right person in the job your career will suffer(...)Mastering great people decisions will do both. It will enhance and improve your personal relationships, and increase your professional satisfaction.""<br /><br />Lesson 2: The Success Formula<br /><br />""...The formula for career success includes at least four other factors (besides luck). They are: 1) Genetics, 2) Development, 3) Career decisions, and 4) People decisions. I am convinced that these factors reinforce and build upon each other, and create a multiplier effect. I also believe these different factors have different weights in our life.""<br /><br />Lesson 3: People Decisions Are Hard<br /><br />""Collectively, these factors  help explain why making people decisions is so damnably difficult: 1) Statistical Odds 2) Difficult Assessments a) Impact of assessment errors b) Unique jobs c) Changing jobs d) Intangible traits e) Inaccessible candidates 3) Psychological Biases a) Procrastination b) Overrating capability c) Snap judgement d) branding e) Evaluating people in absolute terms f) Seeking confirmatory information g) Saving face h) Sticking with the familiar i) Emotional anchoring j) Herding 4) Wrong Incentives a) Candidate circumstances b) Political pressures.""<br /><br />Lesson 4: The Great Paradox<br /><br />The majority of us are not equipped with the right tools to make great people decisions - ""...we get little formal training in making the right people choices, both because of a lack of initial awareness about its importance and because of the false belief that this skill is not learnable. Then, when we're in a position to learn from experience, we often can't learn from experience. And to top it all off, we think we're far better at people choices than we really are(...) And great people decisions need active management. They are less like a physical infrastructure, and more like money: They achieve their true potential only if you figure out how to deploy them effectively.""<br /><br />Lesson 5: Knowing When a Change Is Needed<br /><br />""In order to successfully implement a strategy, not only do the right leaders need to be chosen, but those leaders need to be aligned across the different hierarchical levels of an organization(...)Even when people changes are justified, it's usually very difficult to implement them...your goal should be to define your decision-making process in advance, so that it will be as disciplined and objective as possible.""<br /><br />Lesson 6: What to Look For<br /><br />""1) Knowing what to look for is important because a) Some characteristics are better predictors of success. b) You need to focus youefforts. c) You will avoid discrimination. d) You will be faced with difficult tradeoffs among real candidates. 2) All of the following characteristics are important a) IQ (although most candidates for senior positions already have high levels b) Relevant experience, particularly for senior positions c) Emotional intelligence-based competencies, particularly for senior positions d) Potential, particularly for junior to middle-management levels e) Values, in all cases 3) A highly disciplined process must be followed a) Confirming the managerial priorities b) Identifying the key competencies required c) Clearly defining them in behavioral terms d) Agreeing on the required levels and relative weight for each key competence.""<br /><br />Lesson 7: Where to Look: Inside and Out<br /><br />""Large companies should continually invest in succession plans and inventories of talent and key competencies. In addition, special internal and external efforts should be made for specific needs, particularly at the top. Despite the proliferation of advertising options and the promise of the Internet, direct contacts continue to be extremely powerful. Clever sourcing is both an extremely effective and efficient way to identify highly qualified real candidates. In many cases you can generate most candidates on your own. Professional help can be useful for senior positions, new jobs, when you need to cast a wide net, or for confidentiality reasons.""<br /><br />Lesson 8: How to Appraise People<br /><br />""You can significantly increase your organizational capability in this critical area by: a) Selecting the right assessors b) Training them following proven practices c) Reviewing assessments before confirming the hiring or promotion decision d) Following up over time the results of these decisions, for individual as well as organizational feedback purposes.""<br /><br />Lesson 9: How to Attract and Motivate the Best People<br /><br />""Best practices for attracting and motivating the best people include a) First, understanding the candidate's motivation, concerns, and alternatives b) Sharing your passion about the opportunity c) Paying competitively for the relevant market, without overdoing it d) Setting up the right incentives, with great care in their design e) Properly dealing with any special risks f) Having enough courage to do exceptional things in exceptional cases.""<br /><br />Lesson 10: How to Integrate the Best People<br /><br />"" a) Companies can do several things to support integration: 1) Being proactive at internal communication and candidate preparation 2) Properly preparing the ground within the organization 3) Closely following up the process at regular intervals, monitoring the level of organizational support, relationship building, working of the business model, and setting the stage for early wins. b) Candidates should also take charge of their successful integration: 1) Ensuring the right sponsor 2) Realizing that the integration work is harder than expected 3) Asking up front for the type of organizational support required 4) Focusing on a few key areas 5) Properly managing expectations 6) Confirming the new team 7) Spending enough personal time with all relevant stakeholders.""",5.0,Books,1,7

"Swing Arm Issue: I am mostly happy with my TKO Heavy Bag Wall Mount, and have had it only 1 week.<br /><br />I installed this product using the same format that others had suggested with 2  2""X10"" and 3/8"" X4"" lag bolts.  It is secure to the wall, and easily holds my 100 lbs bag.  (The wood and lag bolds are additional items that need to be purchased.)<br /><br />The swing arm is where I am a bit disappointed.  At first glance the top locking spring loaded pin and bottom screw knob would seem to be sufficient in keeping the arm from moving when locked in place. However, even after double-checking the pin and screw knob to ensure that they are locked down tight, the arm still moves from side to side several degrees during a work out.  In my opinion, if the product is locked in place, landing a few punches should not cause the arm to move at all, but only the bag.<br /><br />All in all, the product does hold my bag and allows the bag to be moved out of the way when not in use.  However, the manufacturing of the product needs additional enhancements to ensure the arm does not move when it is locked in place.",3.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,0,28

"The children of alt-country's father do him justice: While I'm no disciple of Gram Parsons, I admire his work and have been a long-time fan of alt-country. (A love no doubt fostered by having the Mavericks as the house band at my local bar for a few years!) When I chanced upon this disc used, it seemed like a safe bet.<br />It was. In &quot;Return of the Grievous Angel,&quot; I've found a warm, wonderful tribute to Parsons by artists who both understand and respect what his music was all about. While the covers from Wilco, Chris Hillman and Whiskeytown are predictably sublime, a welcomed surprise was the great effort put forth from some unexpected sources.<br />For example, Elvis Costello's &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot; is as remarkable as it is natural, and while it's hard to have much respect for pretty-boy junkie Dando and his whiny rich-kid cohort Hatfield as people, as artists, they DO have a talent for these kind of songs, and their version of &quot;$1,000 Wedding&quot; is outstanding. Heck, even the loathesome Beck (with the help of Emmylou Harris) does a good job here.<br />The only possible miss is the Cowboy Junkies' extremely slick version of &quot;Ooh Las Vegas.&quot; While the production is stellar (you can almost swim through the sound), it sounds a bit too much like a movie soundtrack cliche' to these ears - it's a little TOO good.<br />A minor quibble, though. All fans of alt-country and/or Parsons will be well-served by this gem. Enjoy.",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"A little disappointing, but still better than most: I actually feel bad about writing a less-than-stellar review since I'm still a big fan of the series overall, but this installment just didn't work for me.  The author states in the forward that the events of this book (or at least some of them) are things that she's had in mind since early on, but it really just felt random to me.  The book started out great and I waited with nearly breathless anticipation for the &#34;big bad&#34; to be revealed.  When it was, my first response was &#34;Huh?  Really?&#34;  But since it's McGuire, I figured that I would read on and surely it would all make sense in the end.<br /><br />The problem was that it never really did.  Oh sure, they explain how the Big Bad came to be, but there was so much about this being's actions (past and present) that was just not explained well or at all.  There were some big questions that were not only never answered by the author, but were never really even asked by the characters.  There were certain things that were wrapped up a little to abstractly for me, while other important things were just kicked down the road . . . again.<br /><br />Still, there were a few things that kept this book out of two-star territory.  October was written as well as ever, with a unique personality and voice that I still enjoy reading.  The author managed to avoid a problem facing many long-running series by not getting bogged down with trying to dedicate page-time to every secondary character that our protagonist has ever crossed paths with.  We got to actually concentrate on October, which was refreshing.  Okay, I would've liked to have seen more of May in this book as she's my favorite secondary by far, but you can't always have it all.  The stage has been set for interesting things ahead, but it's a shame that the present wasn't a little more fulfilling.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"Wtf did I just read?: I don’t know where to start with this one.<br /><br />17 yr old Tiernan, two months shy of 17, lonely and angry and never taught what it felt to be loved moves to a remote Colorado cabin with her newly discovered uncle Jake and two sons 21 & 22 yr old Noah and Kaleb.<br /><br />Noah’s the life of the party. Kaleb is the “tortured hero”. Jake is the guy just trying to do right by everyone with hurts of his own to deal with. Tiernan is the shell of a girl that moves in with them and gives them all what they need to heal the wounds of their pasts, for different reasons.<br /><br />The writing isn’t terrible. It has a twilight vibe to it in the beginning. The mountain, the cabin, the snow that’s coming all having a bit of an ominous undertone just like the weather in Twilight’s Forks Washington did with the rain. The weather was an entity all its own in the book.<br /><br />But it is what happens once Tiernan turns 18 that is a great big cluster of wtfs. I understood and could get behind the attachment ms formed but I could not get behind the one who emerges as the “the one”. This is spoilery, but there is sometimes a fine line between tortured hero and psychopath and this author doesn’t do a good enough job keeping it one the side oh tortured hero.<br /><br />This story has consent issues…big time. The first time Kaleb and Tiernan meets is talked about in flowery terms after the fact, but was straight up a big giant red flag of consent issues. Other scenes where Tiernan is punished by Kaleb for one reason or another were nothing but rage inducing. The redeeming qualities that make you understand why the heroine can fall in love with the hero we’re lacking. She loved him before and after anything positive was ever given. It made zero sense how she could fall for someone so outright mean and viscous. I didn’t buy in to this story at all. The heroine was stupid and wishy washy the entire book. Noah was the only bright spot of this story.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"no luck: I bought it in 2012 to kill buckhorn plantain, which it lists. There may have been thousands on my lawn.  Squirting with a pump-up sprayer was easier than digging each one up.  The problem was that it didn't work. I applied it many times over a period of two years, making sure I had the recommended concentration and wet the leaves well.  I never saw a wilted or dead weed as a result.<br /><br />It interfered with mowing for weed control. After mowing, I'd wait a few days for the flower heads to pop up so I could spot the plants easily. After spraying, I'd put off mowing to give the leaves time to absorb the herbicide. Waiting increased the risk that the flowers would go to seed.<br /><br />I resorted to the kind of hand weeder that looks like a big screwdriver with a forked end. You stab to cut the root below the bulb. At first I hated all the bending.  I liked it when I decided the exercise was beneficial. I'll probably never get them all, but my lawn looks better.<br /><br />The spray didn't hurt my lawn, so I'll give it credit for that!",2.0,Unknown,0,32

"OK, not great: I've built thousands of wheels over the past half-century. These rims are decent, but not great. For the price, the seam should be better and it should have eyelets, or at least come with stainless washers. It's tough to seal a tubeless rim with full eyelets, but there are equally decent rims that have half eyelets for less money than these. A disc rim doesn't require the quality of seam as a caliper brake rim does, but I expected better. Ideally, they should be welded, at this price range.

"The elephant in the room: is this card good?: At first glance, this card looks rather unexciting. In most matches it's just a 4/4 creature for 3 mana that doesn't do much else, which is always good, but never really amazing. Granted, it has art of an elephant carrying a giant hammer, which is awesome, but you're not paying $4 for that. So is this card good? Sometimes, yes. It's never bad, sometimes great, and sometimes quite mediocre.<br /><br />First, when do you need this card? If your opponents play zombies, then great, stuff your deck full of these. A 4/4 for 3 mana is a must-kill for zombies, which typically attacks with 2/2 and 3/2 creatures. Even if they just kill the Smiter immediately, that's one less removal spell for your heavy hitters (read: silverblade paladin, sublime archangel, wolfir silverheart) to face.<br /><br />However, if your opponents are playing the kind of deck that plays turn 4 supreme verdicts, this creature simply isn't very good, because it offers you no value in a board stall, and no value after a board sweeper or removal spell. It's also, strangely enough, too slow to adequately pressure a control player compared to stuff like Silverblade Paladin, and does not compare favorably to Thragtusk. Against control decks, you're probably going to want cards that are either faster or harder to deal with, and you're going to want four of Thalia, Guardian of Thraben if you even want a fighting chance. This guy, despite his ""can't be countered"" clause, is not very relevant in a control match.<br /><br />Sorry. You probably wanted me to say, ""this card is the bees knees!"" or, ""This card is not worthy of use as extremely uncomfortable toilet paper,"" but I can't. This card is solid but better choices often exist. Deckbuilding is hard. Welcome to Magic.",3.0,Unknown,0,32

This journal type came up as a good idea for people who are left handers so we do not have to fight the spine of normal journals with our hand.  From the picture that the seller provides it looks like a normal black Journalist Type Journal that is very similar to a basic Moleskine or one of the Amazon journals.  I was disappointed upon first arrival as the cover as different than the image that is attached by the seller.  The second disappointment was the fact that the interior of the journal is dated which is very annoying and honestly quite a turn off point for me.  The back pocket was a nice surprise, but I do have to say that overall the entire journal is not that great.  I posted decent pictures so people can see what they are actually buying.

"Tight, well-written stories that keep you guessing: I picked this up after enjoying Jonathan Face's first novel, Catharsis, and found these stories even better.  Each one is distinct, different, and full of surprises -- while most are horror or suspense, there's also plenty of humor, a touch of sci-fi, and some medieval fantasy to round out the Odd in the title.  My favorite of the bunch was definitely the longest story, ""A Moment of Clarity,"" which kept me guessing throughout and had an ending that was absolutely heart-wrenching.<br /><br />Face has a great voice and an eye for detail, and all of these stories are vivid and easy to read.

"this will be one of the more comfortable chairs you've ever sat in: Why would a $500+ chair only get four stars instead of five? Two small nitpicks: the seat is kinda hard and it's not really for short people. The first nit: When you first sit in it, you might think the chair is too hard and uncomfortable. But once you get the backrest, headrest, tilt, and height set-up, this will be one of the more comfortable chairs you've ever sat in. Give it a chance! The second nit: I'm 5'7&#34; and I can't rest my feet on the ground and maintain a 90 degree angle with my legs/knees. I have to sit forward or position myself on my tip toes or rest my feet on a footrest. This is very common for a lot of office chairs, so I understand it's not really this brand's fault per se. I would have to buy a really small chair to avoid this problem. When high-quality chairs use this kind of hydraulic system, it's generally higher than normal.<br /><br />Now for the good stuff: The build quality is amazing. I picked the real leather option and it feels and looks great. I go through office chairs every 1-2 years because I wear them out and also because I've been buying cheap chairs. Not this time. I'm looking forward to not having to buy a new chair for many years. I love the color combination. The white/black leather is accented with red touches on the side. Very nice. The wheels are sturdy and smooth. When I move back and forth it's like gliding on ice, in a good way!<br /><br />Hope that helps!",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18
"What a great new fantasy series!: This book follows Cat who has rushed home from school since her mother had passed away. Cat is convinced that her mother was murdered and not had a heart attack. As Cat gets back into town the medical examiner arrives to examine the body. There immediately seems something off about the medical examiner right when he arrives and Cat seems alarmed. Cat is still processing her mother's death when her family starts to come to town and the funeral is being held so her emotions do seem a little all over the place and she is just trying to piece everything together to make sense.<br /><br />There were several things I loved in the book. First I want to start with the pace, it was perfect. We got the right information at the right time, which made the book move along at a steady pace. I never felt overwhelmed with the amount of information I was learning and also I didn't have that many unanswered questions at the end of the book, but still wanted the sequel, which to me is something hard to do. We got a look into several of the relationships that Cat has with her friends and her father. I enjoyed the relationship between Cat and her friend Blake. You can easily tell that Blake has feelings for Cat right away and that they might not be reciprocated and you can see that just by the way Cat describes Blake. Blake is there at all the right moments that Cat needs him for and supports her in everything she does. Cat is trying really hard not to lead Blake on, but he is not catching on.<br /><br />I loved Cat as a character. She was honest and upfront about her feelings during the entire book. The book is told entirely through her point of view, but she really goes into internal debates, which allows the reader to get a great picture of her character. She is really just a young adult trying to figure out her life. Cat also misses her mom and they seemed to have had a close relationship. Cat is working on memories to bring her mom to life. Also, Cat gets through into a crazy situation in which she really needs to get a grip on what is going on quickly with no real guidance from anyone she trusts.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed all the details that we were given in the book. It was easy for me as reader to imagine what was going on and what Cat was seeing. I felt like I could easily imagine all of the locations that Cat was going and what she was seeing when she was there. I also felt like I knew what the author was imaging the characters to look like.<br /><br />This is a super quick read, that could easily be read over a weekend. I think my one issue was when it ended I wanted to know what was going to happen next, so be prepared for the wanting the next book immediately!!",5.0,Books,1,7

"A sweet Christmas tale that's tough and tender at the same time: Grace and the promise of new beginnings make Donna VanLiere's fourth novel in The Christmas Hope series, THE CHRISTMAS PROMISE, a charmingly poignant seasonal read.<br /><br />VanLiere tells her story through the characters of the delightful 60-year-old Gloria Bailey and the down-on-his-luck 24-year-old Chaz McConnell. Although tough and practical when it's called for, ""Miss Glory"" has a heart as soft as a marshmallow for those in need. Assisting others also helps Gloria alleviate her own hurts --- the death of her husband and the disappearance of her teenage son seven years ago. ""It's a terrifying thing to give your heart to that small band of people around you, knowing that relationships can be messy and that someday your heart may be broken and you'll come undone."" Every year Gloria puts an envelope on the Christmas tree for her husband with a promise inside it that she'll never stop looking for their missing son.<br /><br />Although she loves helping others, Gloria can't warm up to the person in closest proximity to her --- the irascible widow and next-door-neighbor Miriam. When Miriam's house turns into a disaster area and all the local hotels are booked solid, Gloria offers a room to the woman who repels her the most. How will she survive the holidays with such a bitter, repulsive, sarcastic person?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Chaz is barely making enough money to get by. He's despaired of turning over a new leaf after a checkered past of drinking and gambling, and when he takes a job at Wilson's Department Store in security, he sees it as only temporary. Drinking is still the high point of his days. When Chaz finds himself beginning to care about a little boy whose mother works at the store and worrying about the homeless man who sleeps outside in the cold, he's afraid of his emotions. Caring about people, he believes, comes at too high of a cost.<br /><br />VanLiere does a good job portraying the vicious and abusive cycle women can fall into through the character of Carla, a young single mother who Gloria helps. Although her heart is soft, Gloria is clear-eyed and tough when she needs to be, and under no illusions about those she assists. Some of the sub-themes, such as the couple who keeps their Christmas lights on all year round and the unwed pregnant woman estranged from her mother, are guaranteed to melt the hardest heart, while the antics of the mischievous, fatherless boy Donavan will make readers smile.<br /><br />Themes of forgiveness and unconditional love resonate throughout the novel. It won't take readers long to put two and two together and figure out how the story ends, but even so, they may have to reach for a tissue. The story goes on a little longer than it should, but this will please those who like to have all the loose ends tied up, even if the conclusion seems a bit anticlimactic.<br /><br />Plenty of humor is scattered throughout the book, and readers will especially enjoy some of the sayings on Gloria's plaques. One favorite is this revision of the ""Serenity Prayer"": ""Grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked anyway, The good fortune to run into the ones I do, And the eyesight to tell the difference."" This little quote is going on my refrigerator door.<br /><br />Readers who made THE CHRISTMAS SHOES, THE CHRISTMAS BLESSING and THE CHRISTMAS HOPE popular holiday reads will be delighted with this fourth installment in the series. Fans of happily-ever-after seasonal fiction should also find THE CHRISTMAS PROMISE exactly to their taste.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby",5.0,Books,1,7

"Fitbit fails to deliver: I have owned the Fitbit blaze since it came out and was excited to get the improved functionality on the Ionic so I bought this immediately.<br /><br />I am quite disappointed with a few things....<br /><br />First, functionality.<br /><br />I realize it is still in the early stages and apps have not been created for it, however, while its functions are quite nice, it isn't enough of an improvement from the Blaze to have spent $300 to upgrade. I would say the best function is, if you are a runner, and don't want to carry your phone on runs, it works great for storing some music to listen to. The FitBit pay is unusable (At least for me and my cards), they promise to add more cards to the list at a later date. Having weather on it is kind of nice.<br /><br />One huge improvement was the battery. My Blaze ran 5 days without being charged until I upgraded to a galaxy S8. Which seems to be exactly what happened to everyone else that got this phone, the watch only lasted a day, but only on this phone. The Ionic brought me back to only needing to charge every 5 days. This was an important fix for me.<br /><br />I am completely jealous of my girlfriends apple watch that can run just about every app her phone can run, but I will not own a apple phone, so that leaves that watch out of the running for me. I assume there are other options for smartwatches for android, but because of the customer service FitBit gave to me with my Blaze, I insisted on being a repeat customer without even shopping competitors. I think this was my biggest mistake as their customer service has taken a HUGE turn for the worse since the release of this watch..... Which leads me to the biggest reason I regret buying this....<br /><br />With my Blaze, any time I had any issue, Fitbit jumped all over the issue and made it right. IMMEDIATELY. No questions asked. I was shocked to see a company have this incredible customer service. However... In about two weeks, my Ionic completely locked up and ceased to function. I took a deep breath knowing how well I had been taken care of in the past by Fitbit and knew everything would be just fine.<br /><br />WRONG. This time, Fitbit made me jump through many hoops and hassles. Including sending them videos of its functionality, ect ect. They then said they would replace it, all I needed to do was print their label and when they got it, the new one would be sent out immediately. Ok, great!  Nope.  I immediately printed the label, boxed it, and ran it to my local FedEx shipping center. I wait over a week and decide to call them and find out whats going on. Turns out they must have shipped it by FedEx turtle express because it &#34;would be there tomorrow&#34;. 5 more days pass. Today I get an email saying &#34;Congratulations, you will receive a complementary Ionic but we need all of your information&#34;. So, now I have to resend them all of the information they already have, and wait for them to ship it. I am guessing another 2 weeks before it gets back to me if it is any relation to how it got shipped to them. (Also, note the word complimentary. If it was complimentary, please refund my $300).<br /><br />tl;dr - It is a nice unit as I am use to fitbit. But its reliability is in question. Added functionality is not impressive enough to justify the cost. But most importantly, a previously great customer service has completely crumbled.<br /><br />When I go to replace the Ionic, I will be searching for something other than FitBit this time around.",2.0,Unknown,0,32

"Delivers on its promise of being powerful and little: This book delivers on its promise of both being little and powerful.<br /><br />Even though it has some issues, it's still a very valuable read for anyone considering getting into real estate as a way to build wealth and become financially independent.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- A lot of great information that you can absorb very quickly. (A cool house exchange strategy to pay no taxes, writing off travel costs using real estate, and more.)<br />- Can provide a much needed mindset shift from consumer to producer. His explanation of real estate commissions, and how buying a bigger house every time you move will keep you from ever achieving financial independence.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Book is much smaller than I thought. It contains both the English and Spanish version in the same book (which makes no sense IMO. These should be two different books both for SEO purposes, and buyer understanding purposes.) I still had 50% of the book left when it ended very abruptly and went on to the Spanish part.<br />- His argument for why purchasing a home is a good investment is often &#34;just ask anyone who owns a home!&#34; That can lead to getting information from people who are victims of the sunk cost fallacy (they paid for the house so they want to think it's a good investment) or those who just repeat that information without thinking about it for themselves. Median house prices did beat inflation since 1965 (median price of $20,000 to $210,000 in 2010 VS dollar value due to inflation from $20,000 to $146,904.08 in 2010), however the same $20,000 invested in the S&P index would yield about $250,000 in 2010.<br />HOWEVER, neither of these account for human element and the panic selling you might do during down markets for both real estate and the S&P, OR the fact that specific housing areas might appreciate greatly (Austin) or depreciate greatly (Detroit).<br /><br />That said, would I still recommend this book?<br /><br />Yes! It's a quick, but valuable read for anyone who wants to achieve financial independence and who is considering using real estate as a way of getting there (or maintaining your wealth.)",4.0,Books,1,7

"Styrofoam inserts are too small: This product is just okay. It does what I hoped it would—blocks cold drafts and some noise from coming into my room—but it looks quite ugly. The styrofoam inserts are way too small for the pockets, and they’re too far apart. When I used the Velcro adhesive strip, my door wouldn’t shut, so I had to take it off. Because of this, the draft stopper slides around when I open and close the door. The color and fabric look very different than the pictures.

"Touching, heartfelt, and educational: Because I have spent so much of my life around children who were growing up in the foster care system, I know that every child there has a story to tale.

I think this is must read for people thinking of reaching out to children from broken homes, and opening up their hearts and houses to crystal children.

The story was entertaining, and honestly how many of us wishes something similar could happen to one of our exes. Unfortunately for me, I did not like our main character.  There was just something about her personality that put me off early on in the book. Now with that said do I think that this is a bad book? NO. I just did not jive with a character, which happens.

"Shoddy product: I was dismayed when I opened the box of this movie, discovering it was a ""flippy"" DVD. For those uninitiated, a ""flippy"" is a 2-sided DVD with both the Widescreen and Standard versions of the film (or maybe the documentary and extras in the back side.<br /><br />Regretably, this usually is a sign that you'll have to buy another copy in 5 to 10 years; a ""flippy"" DVD is just an aluminum layer and the necesary data layers trapped inside two thin plastic platters. Your life expectancy of such a contraption depends on the quality of the glue used to hold the thing together. If the glue is poorly applied or becomes porous with age, air will seep in and start oxidizing the aluminum layer... effectively destroying its reflective capabilities, thereby killing your DVD copy.<br /><br />As expected (I bought my copy in Sept. 2008), the disk's shiny surface has started to darken in a circular pattern around the outer edges, which are surefire first signals of DVD-rot. This blemish will slowly extend all over the disk, and my copy of the ""Wedding Singer"" will be dead by the end of the year.<br /><br />If you want to buy a copy of this movie, make sure you're getting a standard DVD, instead of a ""flippy""... it will save you the aggravation of having to buy a new copy as years go by...",1.0,Movies_and_TV,0,22
"Fits okay: CONTEXT<br />I live in Hawaiʻi and my 2016 Toyota 4Runner is in the sun more than it isn't! I grew up with having these dash covers and know it's good and helps to protect the dash from sun damage so after a couple of years I decided to buy this.<br /><br />PROS<br />- This is so inexpensive! Honestly, can't complain.<br />- It came folded up (obviously), so there are a few creases in the dash cover. However, unlike many of the other reviews I've read, my creases weren't so bad.<br /><br />CONS<br />- It came with instructions to place the cover under something heavy to remove the creases, but let's be real.

"Not perfect design but very good.: This item is made fairly well with pretty decent materials. I have a lot of Berry Compliant milspec gear and can make them as well so I am fairly familiar with construction methods. The material has water resistant backing and features decent edge binding and stitching. Not milspec but pretty good. The stitch spacing is a bit too wide and tension a bit too loose for milspec. Stitching melts so it is not cotton. I think this bag would be just fine for a citizen medical professional, but for military field use where replacements may not come for some time it is probably not quite sufficient. It has proper bar tacks in certain places and slightly wonky box stitches (but they're there). Many of the webbing attachment points are backed by an additional layer of material as well. The main bag compartment has padding for the sides, bottom and dividers. Zippers are not YKK but they're doubled for the end pouches and they move pretty decent.<br />Regarding it's design, I would say the top cover needs to be a shade longer to cover the front pouches when its all loaded and the shoulder strap isn't really load centered but centered on the main pouch only. Place heavy stuff at the back of the main pouch to help balance it. The product comes in a large box but it's crumpled into a little ball like trash. I stuffed it with things to get it to loosen up and straighten out. There is also writing on the outside in chalk pencil which looks to be QC tracking, etc. It wipes right off with a damp cloth. There is absolutely no way it's a used bag, etc. The center dividers are sewn in but no doubt easy to cut out if necessary (not a bad idea as other posters noted).  The reflective strips on the outside work quite well and seem like decent material. In heavy rain, as others noted, the front two pockets would get slightly wet. That is unfortunate because it's best to put light stuff (like bandages) in there to load balance the bag. The entire top cover is double layered with a zipper inside at the hinge point to act as a document pouch, etc.<br />I would recommend taking the bag to a sewing pro and having MOLLE webbing or a pouch of some sort sewn on the back side to even out the balance of it. Perhaps sewing a few cheap pouches directly for tourniquets, etc.<br />All in all it seems like a pretty decent bag for the money. It is made in China, of course.",4.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"More Attractive than Useful: I have had this in my parrotlet's and my lovebird's cage for over a month and the birds have not used it even once and seem to avoid it.  Both species love Happy Huts or Cuddle Huts but don't like this bottomless type of hut at all.  I also noticed that when I read the other reviews, many of them say how cute this hut is (it is) but that their birds are not using it.  My recommendation is to buy a regular happy hut or cuddle hut, check frequently for fraying or threads, and save some money and buy one of those instead of this.  It's a nice concept, and I can see some birds will like it, but overall, it is a less successful product because the birds don't like it as well as some other products.<br /><br />I wanted to include here a recipe for a fresh diet that a breeder I highly respect gave me just to offer some advice to keep our pet birds healthier - it is not at all related this the product I have reviewed here but it could very well give you some great ideas to get fresh fruits and vegetables into your bird.<br /><br />All domestic birds, especially parrots, lovebirds, parrotlets, parakeets, canaries, finches, conures, etc, should have fresh fruit and vegetables and they can present a challenge to get them to eat them.  Gives this recipe a try Here's a recipe that I make and it took some time for them to get used to it, but now my lovebirds and my parrotlets both eat this when provided.  I give it in the morning and remove uneaten food in the evening.<br />1 apple cored and chopped<br />1/2 Cup chopped raw broccoli<br />1 Chopped bell pepper seed included<br />2 shredded carrots<br />1/2 Cup chopped greens (bok choy, mustard greens, kale and/or chard)<br />1/4 Cup frozen corn (can be eliminated if you put slices of raw corn on the cob in treat holders/clips in your cage - all my birds LOVE it and I have had 100% success getting them to eat this)<br />1/4 Cup frozen peas<br />1/2 Cup cooked rice (brown or GABA brown rice)<br />1/2 Cup cooked dried beans (they will need to be soaked overnight for 8 hours)<br />A handful of blueberries, chopped cherries and chopped seedless grapes<br />Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl. Place ingredients in an ice cube tray and freeze. Remove frozen cubes and place in plastic bags to store in freezer. Then you can take out the perfect portion on a daily basis . They say 1 cube per bird but you may bind that 1 cube will work well for a pair of birds of if smaller birds, even more.  Instead of an ice cube tray I use slider freezer bags and press them flat after I fill them with enough of the mixture and this way I can easily break off appropriate sized pieces.  This recipe is variable and you can switch out or add/delete ingredients that you have on hand or what you know your birds already like.<br /><br />This recipe is in ADDITION to their regular diet of pellets and seeds and not a substitute.",3.0,Pet_Supplies,0,26

"It's worth it, but you have to take time to learn: I have now used the machine for 3 times.  In photo one, I do not have makeup on.  In photo two, this is the makeup I currently use.  Photo three is using this product as well as adding eye shadow.  I tried to get the same lighting.  Photos 1 & 2 were taken back to back.  Photo 3 was the third time I have used the machine and their makeup.  I will say I have been told it doesn't look like I put any makeup on when I have worn this product.  Since I do not have a place to leave the machine sitting out, I have to set it up each time.  The time to apply this makeup compared to my other makeup is about the same.  I do have to use about 10 drops of makeup for 1 coat of base.  I have to use 5-7 drops for my cheeks.  Not sure about the setting spray as I prefer to dust powder over my face instead of a moist look you get from the setting spray.

It would have been ideal to have them with holes already, as not everyone has the tools and skills for it, but I understand not everybody wants to use these to decorate and hang.

"Works Well, Not Sold On The Scent: I used this product on laundry day over the past few weeks, and it's been interesting....I'm not crazy about this particular scent, which is almost overwhelmingly flowery. There were a few hit-and-miss moments, thanks to the non-specific instructions...It basically says &#34;Sprinkle in a capful of this stuff.&#34; I threw it in on top of the clothes the first few times, which resulted in a lot of semi-melted pellets stuck to the sides of the upper part of the washing machine basket. (I didn't find any semi-melted pellets on the clothes, however.) After that, I started throwing the pellets into the basket before I added the clothes, which yielded mush better results- All of the pellets melted that way.<br /><br /> The clothes all came out smelling very flowery, which is not a bad thing, but I'd say you should go light on this stuff until you figure out how much scent you can deal with. I find that a little less than a half-capful works best for me and my family. My wife was impressed by the fresh smell, and it seems to linger all day while wearing the clothes. I'd say it was a success. I'm not sure if I'd be willing to actually buy the product again in the future. It's nice, but I didn't like it enough that I would add another expense to my shopping bill, potentially a hefty one, considering it's now selling for twenty bucks on Amazon, which is just insanity.",3.0,Health_and_Household,0,16

"A Cauldron of Colorful Characters Engaging in Mischief: To say that I have hugely enjoyed reading all of the author’s 13 novels would be an understatement. For me, each one is a droll, fun read packed with colorful characters, espionage double-dealings, wonderful dialogue, carefully researched settings, and lots of affairs and infidelity with a few violent episodes thrown in. Moscow Exile has all of these author trademark qualities in spades.<br /><br />Just listing the novel’s major characters is a challenge – British Ambassador to Russia Lord Frederick Troy and his second wife Lady Anna Troy; Double Agent Charles Leigh-Hunt, SIS Information Officer at the British Embassy in Moscow; Joe Wilderness, kidnapped by the Russians; Charlotte (Coky) Mawer-Churchill Redmaine as she gallops through husbands in high society; KGB Major Magda Ewald, Charles Leigh-Hunt’s lover; journalist Mario Mariotti; Kim Philby and Guy Burgess, two high-profile British traitors; all supported by a bunch of memorable lesser players.<br /><br />Moscow Exile spans the period of 1943 to 1969 and is mainly set in Washington, D.C., Moscow, London and Berlin. Its plot revolves around the attempts of the British Secret Service and the CIA to uncover the identity of a high level Russian spy whose code name was “Mockingbird”.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Fun Romance: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. The opinions in this review are my own. J.D. Holllyfield has done a wonderful job with this romance genre novel. I really enjoyed reading about Sarah Sullivan and Jack Calloway. I found Sarah to be a very likable and relatable character. Jack is a surprising and raw character. Holllyfield infuses humor and reality into the storyline. As a reader I enjoyed the way the storyline plays out and the twists and turns Sarah's life takes. I felt this book had a good blend of real life and romanticized, fairy tale love. Sarah's character has a very sexy and active imagination in this story. The love scenes can get very passionate and steamy. I am a reader that likes the steam and passion so this was a book that was my cup of tea. I felt that the love scenes and steaminess were relevant to Sarah's developing relationship with Jack. They were steamy in a romantic way and pleasantly erotic. Holllyfield took a different turn with this book, she turned away from the raw, unromantic coupling that other books might have. I found it a pleasant change of pace, I like to vary the kinds of romance I read so that I can experience, rather second hand, a variety of romantic scenarios. I look forward to reading more of Hollyfield's works. I recommend this book to other readers that are looking for something good to read.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"NEEDS AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO: OMG!!!! After 3 hours of fiddling with this thing, I finally got the desired aesthetic around my balcony entrance (blurred the view for privacy reasons). That was ridiculous. At one point I cried because I thought it wouldn't work and that I couldn't return it b/c I already tried to apply it and I thought I wasted $30. Long story short - read ""Dan Wooten""'s review!!!! It should be the first one that comes up when sorted by ""top reviews"". The instruction manual was VERY UNCLEAR about how to use the connectors, and I NEEDED the connectors to work because I had already cut the strip lights about 5 times (I needed to in order to get it around my balcony entrance). Also, opening the connectors will break your nails!!! I don't get my nails done so I don't care, but I wanted to mention that for people who do. Finally, be careful with the adhesive! The first time I tried to remove the 3M backing, the adhesive removed with it and stuck to the brown 3M backing rather than the strip light! Luckily I caught it early on and just used regular tape for the small portion where the adhesive wasn't on the strip light, but that was a third frustrating factor.<br /><br />All in all, the lights are amazing, super bright, work well with my Alexa, and are so fun with all the different settings. BUT that installation process is a NIGHTMARE. The music synchronization can be off sometimes, but that's a minor factor.<br /><br />I used the entirety of the 32 feet for my balcony entrance outline.",4.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

The Opposite: Due to a motorcycle accident I am now a speed walker. I walk an average of six miles a day and I bought these socks as a recommendation from a fleet feet employee when I went to buy a new pair of sneakers. Glowing review. So you can imagine my disappointment when I developed blisters on my big toes. I chopped it up to the new shoes. No problem. Switched back to my old ones for a couple of days. Worked my way back up from 3 miles to 6. By the third day/6 miles I pulled of my shoes and voila  HUGE blisters on both heels. I guess didn’t  feel them come in because I was zoning.<br /><br />With as high a cost per pair - and I bought a few pairs - I would’ve been better off buying another set of compression socks. Would’ve saved a few dollars too.<br /><br />So disappointed,2.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0,10
"One Blood, is one good read.: I received this book from the author in return for an honest review.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed Qwantu Amaru's novel One Blood. It introduced me to many things I had no knowledge of prior to reading it.  It's set in Louisiana with a timeline that spans a good deal of recent history. It gave me a better understanding of points of view I could never experience (since I'm not black). I found myself fascinated with the motivations behind a number of the characters. I became intrigued to see how everything was goings be drawn together. Some relationships I guessed on my own but at least one came as a huge surprise. Woven through the whole story was the use of Vodoun and how it affected the people involved. Many of the details were so perfect it was delightful.<br /><br />I could not give this 5 stars for two reasons,<br />1) I found myself at times inexplicably not wanting to read. I do not think it was anything to do with the quality of the story. However a truly unforgettable story (5 star) will get me to read despite my own ill humors.<br />2) I picked this up as horror/paranormal novel, while I grant many parts can be described as horrific and parts would be terrifying if personally experienced. I never felt scared or horrified. Thrilled, fascinated, excited, many things but not scared.<br /><br />For a good read with great characterization and an amazing setting you can't go wrong. The writer has a wonderful attention to detail in every area.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Excellent Gift: Making a magical apocalyptic manhattan is, at best, a long shot. The majority of these media types are destined to fail before they begin. As an avid manga and anime fan, i judge books by their covers(at least the back preview). When making my way through a local stores manga section, I spied, amongst the plain white backed character portraits, a dysmal reddish sky with a melancholic young man and one bold word, Wizard. I stopped, arms full of all 12 Death note volumes, and gazed at its wonderful cover. I balanced the other manga and picked it up to read the back. I then set it down and purchased my manga. Two weeks later, i found it again. This time i flipped through it. I felt like i got slapped. This wonderful work of art I had ignorantly set down jumped at me liked Harry potter never could. I purchased it and read it on the way home. I was intrigued by its story and couldnt stop. The art was immersive and the story gripping. No amount of wand waving could match these wizards. I have read it five times since and would recommend it to anyone tired of typical manga. THIS is Chris Angels bad acid trip to hell. And for the price, it is hard to beat.",5.0,Books,1,7

NOT the abridged [[ASIN:1857988191 Gollancz paperback]] of the same title).<br /><br />This is one of of the more substantial anthologies, and may serve as a complement to [[ASIN:0345245814 The Best of Cordwainer Smith]], as they have no stories in common.<br /><br />The contents are:<br /><br />&bull; No, No, Not Rogov!<br />&bull; Mark Elf<br />&bull; The Queen of the Afternoon<br />&bull; When the People Fell<br />&bull; Think Blue, Count Two<br />&bull; The Colonel Came Back from the Nothing-at-all<br />&bull; From Gustible's Planet<br />&bull; Drunkboat<br />&bull; War Nº 81-Q<br />&bull; Western Science is So Wonderful<br />&bull; Nancy<br />&bull; The Fife of Bodidharma<br />&bull; Angerhelm<br />&bull; The Good Friends",5.0,Books,1,7

"No bass, but clear sound: I like the case, it seems sturdy and secure.  The earbuds themselves are a little uncomfortable to me, but I have generally had the softer cushion earbuds and this is the first time I've tried any of the hard plastic in-ear style, and I know plenty of people who prefer this style.  I was surprised by the sound quality - these are very clear without any fuzziness.  There is absolutely no bass to them, but they weren't advertised as having bass, so this wasn't a surprise.  My biggest complaint would have to be the controls.  They have the ability to pause/play songs, go to the next or previous song, or change the volume, however all of these functions are a matter of tapping the earpieces themselves either once, twice, or three times.  Most of the time when I was trying to do a double tap (to switch to the next track) it would actually just pause then start playing the same track again.  When I tried to adjust the volume, it would change tracks.  There might be a learning curve to getting it just right, but I might just find it too frustrating to try and perfect and just continue to control the music via my phone.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"first Kristen Ashley book, pretty good: This is the first Kristen Ashley book that I've read. I read the short novella in the Jill Shalvis Christmas anthology and was interested enough to read this. First of all, it was a good book and ultimately I liked it. Something I had to get through was the language and dialogue -- it also made it hard in the anthology and I wasn't sure if I'd like the books or not. For some reason, most of the characters talk in incomplete sentences and without complete thoughts --- it can be very distracting and sometimes I skipped the less important dialogue just because it's hard to read sometimes.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't really like about the book -- she starts off with Shy's point of view in third person, moves the majority of the book to Tabby's point of view in first person, and then ends with Shy's 3rd person point of view again. This is really distracting. First, I really like having the book in Shy's point of view -- there should have been MORE of that. It's hard to switch from third to first to third again, also. I wish it had all been in third or all in first. I think it would have been better served to have more of Shy's point of view in the book.<br /><br />Another thing -- it seemed like the romance got wrapped up really quickly so the rest of the drama was just fluff throw in to make the book longer. It could have ended a lot earlier than it did or had more build up in the beginning. The last third of the book wasn't really necessary at all.<br /><br />I liked it enough that I read the second in the series and the second has pretty much the same issues as the first, but I think I'll read Tyra's story anyway. I'm not sure she'll become a must read author but it was good for a snow day . . .",3.0,Books,0,7

By flipping a classroom the learning is essentially placed in the hands of our students. This book broke down segments into small understandable information. While this book is small it is mighty and gives the reader options for starting a flipped classroom. Bergmann and Sams has had a wonderful impact on my teaching style and in my classroom.

Although the story premise is good, and the author truly did try - and I WANTED to like this book - it didn't hit the mark for me. In particular, the dialog was just ghastly boring. Dialog should sizzle, snap, surprise. It should make you want to spend time with the characters. The Hired Man had none of that. Its few attempts at humor were lukewarm at best. I found  H (&#34;Cord&#34;) much more interesting and likable than the h, whose name (Eleanor?) I can barely remember, although I just finished reading this about ten minutes ago. The point of view was inconsistent and confusing in places, and, actually, so were the words & actions of the two leads. And BTW, some of the scenes were just odd. Like when Cord tops off her morning coffee with brandy - why did he do that? Or when he explains to the little boy about cats making babies - how they &#34;touch each other in a special way&#34;?

"Requires finger and hand strength: I appreciate the concept of this product as a way to minimize waste that comes from throwing away single-use spray bottles. The materials are also quite nice, especially the glass bottle. Unfortunately, it requires a lot of finger and hand strength to spray the bottle multiple times in a row. We're able to spray 1-2 times without issue, but then the bottle stops spraying and we have to push the button multiple times with a lot of force to get another spray of olive oil. We also had to cut the tube that goes into the bottle as it was touching the side and preventing any oil from getting up to the spray nozzle. I wish I could rate this product highly as I like the concept and the quality of the materials seems good; however, I wonder if anything could be improved internally to prevent oil buildup and reduce the required finger and hand strength needed to operate it.",2.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

"Powerful and mature Kylesa sound: Ultraviolet by Kylesa is a powerful, driving record that shows an evolution of the band's sound into new areas. In my opinion, it is the best Kylesa record to date and is the first record of theirs to really make me stop and take notice of the sound they have been cultivating over the past 11 years. To be honest, I came to this album a little bit skeptical. I first listened to Kylesa on their 2010 release Spiral Shadow (so to be clear, I haven't been a fan from the beginning). While I enjoyed that album, there were several things that weren't exactly my cup of tea. I felt that the ""dual drummer"" sound was crowded and confused, the songs were a bit repetitious, and the strengths of the multiple vocalists weren't being fully utilized. I am happy to say that all of these concerns have been addressed on Ultraviolet and the result is a fantastic record.<br /><br />The album opens with the powerful ""Exhale"", showcasing the chant-style vocals that Kylesa is known for. Right away I noticed that the drums were less crowded, resulting in a cleaner sound. This song really drives and kicks things off in a great way. The second song, ""Unspoken"", begins to mix in a bit of the softer/trippy side of the band, which is more heavily showcased on the back half of the album. This is one of the catchier songs on Ultraviolet and showcases Laura Pleasants vocals in a great way. The album progresses from there, with the first half focusing more on heavier/powerful songs and the back half focusing on somewhat lighter songs. Overall, the mood of the album just feels comfortable and you really get the sense that Kylesa is settling into a sound of their own.<br /><br />While I am a fan on the entire album, there are two tracks in particular that really stand out for me. The first is ""We're Taking This"", the fourth song on the album. I LOVE the vocal delivery that Laura Pleasants delivers on this track. It is heavy, in your face, and commanding. I would listen to an entire album with her delivering this vocal style any day. The second stand out track for me is ""Steady Breakdown"". This one has such a great sound with a monster guitar riff and amazing ethereal vocals. The first time I heard it, I couldn't help but think that it sounded like Stevie Nicks singing with Black Sabbath. So cool and the standout track overall for me on the album.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that a few of the songs later on the album feel a bit redundant and don't stand out. ""Vulture's Landing"", ""Quicksand"", and ""Drifting"" are all cool songs in their own right, but don't jump out at me like some of the earlier songs on the album. With that said, they still really fit the mood of the album and don't leave you disappointed.<br /><br />In my opinion, this album showcases all of the great elements about Kylesa and remedies some of the things I haven't loved on their earlier albums. I would definitely recommend this and I will eagerly look forward to what Kylesa does next.",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

Great flavor: My friends were BBQ and I asked what they put on the burger. And this was the stuff!! I had to buy it. For the first time cooking chicken it actually packed the chicken with flavor.

You pretty much can put this on anything. I would say for the size little pricy but it is really good! Great for adding in a bag choice of meats and olive oil and springle of Paleo.

"Funny, quirky romance with a mystery: Greengage Shelf by Emma Sterner-Radley is the third story in this series. It is set in a wonderfully quirky island, chock full of eccentric characters. Our heroine, Kit Sorel, is the local librarian and an incomer to the island. She has  a gift for sorting out other people’s problems, and because of this, local lady, Widow Caine, asks her to look into a puzzling problem. The mysterious case of the missing book has Kit and her girlfriend Laura embroiled in all sorts of happenings – and finding out things about their neighbours they’d probably rather not know. Ms Sterner-Radley has a delightful writing style that has a gentle humour woven with lovely descriptive elements. She sees the ridiculous in every situation and her use of footnotes in this novel had me giggling. The island is the place that time forgot and is old-fashioned and endearing. There is a lovely cosy feel about the whole series and I must admit to enjoying cosy.

"Mostly good, but flawed for girls: My three and a half year old daughter really enjoys this book. It's written in a style that's entertaining and easy to understand. I like that the authors have included many types of families in the illustrations, and have tried to combat gender stereotypes by discussing all of the similarities about what boys and girls like (both boys and girls like active play; both boys and girls play with dolls). However, there is one flaw in the book that bothers me as I read it to my little girl. In the descriptions of the external physical attributes of boys and girls, boys' external genitalia is named, while girls' is not. Boys are described as having ""a penis, a scrotum, and two openings."" Girls, on the other hand, are described as having merely ""three openings."" And while there are indeed a penis and scrotum visible in the picture accompanying the boy's description, in the girl's, the little girl resembles a Barbie doll with a smooth genital area and three dots representing her openings. The little girl has no clitoris at all, and just a hint of labial folds. I understand that a clitoris may have been a little tougher to draw than a penis, but to completely excise a part of female genitalia in a book about the topic? What is a little girl supposed to think about that part of her anatomy? According to this book, it shouldn't exist and doesn't have a name. But if you have a daughter, you know that she knows it's there. The first time we read this book, my daughter was confused and wondered if she had a penis, because she said she had a ""bump like that"" and pointed to the picture of the little boy's genitals.<br /><br />Since my daughter still likes to read this book, and since I do like the rest of it, I choose to just add in the words when I read it to her. I read that sentence as ""Between their legs, girls, baby girls, and women have a clitoris, a vulva and three openings."" I point to the picture and say ""her clitoris is here, just above the opening where the pee comes out"" (which is how the urethral opening is described in the book). It's not a perfect solution, and while I understand the authors' intent to rely on very simple descriptions, it would be great to know the reasoning behind completely omitting a visible part of a girl's body. We're already so squeamish about girls' genitals, calling their genitalia their flower, their bits, their woo-woo... is it too much to ask that in a book about their bodies, visible female parts should be represented and named?",3.0,Books,0,7

Any way this thing has changed my life.  My first 3 kids didn't have teething toture at all then #4 got hit hard on the teething front!  He would stop eating for 4 to 5 days, he was even loosing weight from not eating with all of his teeth coming in so early, fevers, super fussy, wouldn't sleep, just wanted to be held but didn't want to be held all at the same time :(<br /><br />I figured for $18 it was worth the gamble plus they guarantee your money back so I had nothing to loose.  At 6 months my little one had 6 teeth, he is now 11 months and is working on his 3rd and 4th molar... no joke people!  My other 3 had maybe 2 or 3 teeth by this age not 12!!<br /><br />So after tooth #7 came in I got the necklace, put it on him with #8 in tow and it completely kicked the fevers, his appetite went down some to were he would eat some food but would still nurse verses before he wouldn't eat of nurse at all for 4 or 5 days. The biggest thing of all...<br /><br />HE SLEPT AND WAS HAPPY oh and he stopped loosing his cute baby rolls and fatten up again!!!<br /><br />This will be my gift for new moms from now on, so worth every penny and more!<br /><br />Great product!!",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Excellent sandal: I've worn Okabashi Eurosports for years and loved them. They've lasted a few years each, with heavy use, until a strap finally rips off. Just ordered a new pair. The strap on one sandal arrived with a tear in it and I had to send them back. I ordered another pair and these arrived in perfect condition. I wear a 12 shoe and the XXL (12-13) is a perfect fit. I compared the new one to my old ones, which I still have (at least 4 years old). and I don't see the difference in ""formula"" that some reviewers have noted. The new ones feel the same to me, and don't ""squeak"" when I walk, as one review said.<br />Small complaint: the red Okabashi label shown in the photos has been changed to black in the actual product. Not as attractive or distinctive IMO. They should change back or at least change the photo to reflect the actual product.",5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"A boost physically & psychologically.  Stopped my soreness and helped me focus on better, longer workouts.: I recently bought a bike which came with a very basic seat.

"My favorite out of 3 astronaut projectors: Body is light but the head makes it a bit heavier so it doesn't go flipping over. The magnet is strong enough to pick the guy up by his head. The head can go in about a 270 left and right (the decorative cord from the backpack to the helmet makes it not go 360). The head can also tilt back to be practically facing straight up, but won't go back any further (there is no magnet for the back of the head).<br />There is a very faint hum that you really only hear if you're paying attention to it.<br />Nebula colors go red, blue, green, red/blue, blue/green, green/red, a gentle fade through these color schemes, and lastly all three colors at once. The nebula is a very pretty cloud looking. The stars have different settings from always on, always off, and a fade setting where they slowly fade in and out.<br />The cord also works with the big standing version, except the angle of the plug is different between the cords, and this cord also has specs written on it.

"Good starting point for Missouri research: The series by Mr. Schweitzer covering a number of states is an excellent starting point for most researchers as well as a handy reference to have.

There are undoubtedly books that go into greater detail on each state but the Schweitzer series are a great starting point and well worth the money if you're researching there. His titles usually have to be ordered at local booksellers so Amazon is your best bet at getting these quickly and painlessly. One particular note is that this title was written years ago and some telephone numbers and addresses have changed and some groups or societies may be dormant or closed. Additionally Mr. Schweitzer does not make reference to internet sources or email addresses, which is just as well as they tend to get out-of-date quite quickly. I've gotten considerable use out of this title on Missouri and it continues to be very helpful.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Beautifully designed and superbly crafted set: This is the second decanter and glass set I have purchased from Nou Living. The first decanter set I bought, the ELEGANCE model (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HDC5PHL) so impressed my self-proclaimed whisky snob brother, I gave it to him. This new set is even better, in my opinion.<br /><br />The decanter design and glass cutting is well executed, and the crystal stopper for the decanter is flawless. The glasses have a very nice heft to them, fit well in your hand, and the cutting on the glasses is again well done, and provides a great non-slip purchase when lifting and drinking from them. The whiskey balls are large, and cover almost the entire bottom of the glass. They were easily able to cool three fingers of bourbon, and stayed cool throughout multiple refills during the evening.<br /><br />This set looks really nice on the counter or on your bar. I'm hoping Nou Living will be using their great design skills and will be coming out with some nicely designed trays that will hold this set!<br /><br />I highly recommend these as gifts to yourself or others, as the quality and design are top notch, they feel great in your hand, and to me they compare favorably to sets costing hundreds of dollars.",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Don't believe the negative comments: Im not much of a review writer but I felt it necessary due to all the other comments. They call it ""The Secret"".. and even though we all know these things (instinct, intuition, the bible, physics, etc), its difficult for anyone to assemble them in a pretty little package and use them in every day life. I have been following ""The Secret"" for years without knowing it. This movie sort of connected the dots and filled in the blanks. I'm a very intelligent, rational person and know this is the real deal. I have personally benefited from whats talked about and it does truly change your life.<br /><br />The comments below are NEGATIVE. and in the movie itself it says that negativity attracts more negativity so if these people have that attitude they will get more of the same. Its just the laws of physics. This is not about money, this is about a spiritual journey to whatever you want in life (its true and it really works). If it were about money there would have been a blockbuster release, sex scenes, a plot, an ending, action, actors, etc.. This has none of the above.

"This book is like a hug from Gunnar Erickson: A smile can hide a multitude of scars, and for Frankie Reeves, that is definitely true. Life has Frankie closed off as she follows her routine until Gunnar Erickson walks into her ER.<br /><br />Gunnar Erickson is trying to make a name for himself separate from the legacy of his older brother, Cage. He's always looked up to him so he moved to Green Valley to train at Cage’s new gym. When a freak accident lands him in the ER, he locks eyes with the PA assigned to his case.<br /><br />Frankie's eyes are the first thing he noticed. Her EYES! And once she's in his sights, he's determined to get her to give him a chance.<br /><br />As the slow burn builds between them, we learn more about the pair and what has led them to this point in time. Frankie’s life hasn’t been easy, so watching Gunnar be what she needs and defer to her without anger was so refreshing. We could all use a Gunnar Erickson in our lives.<br /><br />By the time the book ends, I’m ready for their sequel. I want so much more time with them. This book gives you all of the feels.

Initially I could tell a big difference. Not sure if the effects waned or if I've just gotten used to more energy. I have seen the effects wear off by about 4, so I may start taking a second dose about 3pm to see if that helps.

"You'll Be Sorry You Bought This!: I bought  a 5' x 8' one at the local home improvement store for $199 about 3 years ago. It was an impulse purchase. I thought it was going to be great for only $200 and was so excited.  My son put it together in a couple of hours.  I was very happy with it.  BUT.........I am now ready to trash it and trying to come up with a way to recover the frame so I won't have to trash that.<br /><br />Within the first year the little plastic ball slide bungies were all coming off.  I wasn't sure if they were rotting from the sun or if wild things were chewing on them.  Then the plastic started ripping away from the canvas. Then the back door zipper wouldn't close. When I finally got it closed later I came to see that the stress had ripped the zipper stitching and left a big hole in the back of the shed.<br /><br />The roof is ripped in several places and the back wall is hanging. I am embarrassed to have this in my yard and have come up with a way to recover the frame I think.  I have a chain link dog kennel that has been covered with heavy beige shade cloth for 10 years. The zip ties eventually rot from the sun and the shade cloth starts flapping but it has never ripped, not even at the hole I made for a mister to keep the dogs cool.  Once a year my son and I just re-do the zip ties.  I am going to cover the sides with the shade cloth leaving the front open and cover the top with a vinyl or water resistant canvas tarp.  I am hoping I can make it look halfway decent or the frame will be going to metal recycle.  Maybe I could use the frame as a support to grow green beans!

"Highly recommend this atmospheric and heartfelt page turner: Karis Hylan is a 30-something New Yorker who has settled into an isolated life in her apartment and her office at work; when a deadly virus sweeps the east coast, Karis's reclusive tendencies make her one of the few survivors. Confined to her apartment as the days turn to weeks and then months (and with little company save her dog, Zeke, occasional phone calls to her mother on the west coast, and conversations through the windows with two young girls across the breezeway), Karis witnesses the looting and burning of the city, the failure of the power grid and the steady deterioration of what's left of humanity. As her few remaining connections to the old world vanish, Karis hatches a plan to escape the city and drive across the country toward salvation.<br />There are tragedies and sorrow aplenty in this book, but it is mostly concerned with Karis's ingenuity, persistence, and her will to carry on. Mabry keeps the surprises and challenges coming to create a gripping, heartbreaking, and un-put-down-able story from start to finish. Karis Hylan is a survivor, a more badass version of MacGyver, and the first person you'd want on your side in an apocalypse -- and her journey is nothing short of beautiful.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"One of the Best TV Shows Ever Made: I really have to hand it to Joss Whedon, this really is an awesome show. I hated Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Also by Joss.) But this... this is pure gold, and cancelled after less than a season? Shame on you Fox. But to make up for it, they gave us this: The boxed set of the entire first season, even the episodes they never aired.<br /><br />But what really makes this show? You might ask. Well, it's the characters. Mal, Kaylee, Jayne; all of them are absolute genius. In their own way they are each funny and interesting and the way they interact seems natural as well as well written. I have not seen characters I have loved so much in a long time, on the same level as characters from good literature.<br /><br />Another thing which makes this show is it's setting, there is an undeniable wild west flavor to the entire show from the firearms to the fiddles and twangs of the soundtrack, to their method of speech. (Which I find extremely charming.)<br /><br />Let us not forget the story! It isn't... outstanding, but it is interesting and keeps you guessing. I had the general flow of the story layed out for me by Serenity (The movie based off of the show.) and it's what got me interested to begin with. But the show still held a lot of surprises. And the setting is in the distant future, when man is colonizing space, the final frontier (I believe this to be the reason for the wild west theming.)<br /><br />I really can't suggest this highly enough if you even remotely like Sci-Fi, a Sci-Fi with no aliens and a somewhat believable vision of the Terran future of mankind.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

Carport: We bought one of these over 2 years ago and the canvas roof just started leaking. We just bought another complete kit and traded out the roof canvas(Polypropylene).  I think it started leaking because we have a side kit on it and we had a boxelder bug infestation this summer. We sprayed a lot of bug killer on and around the roof and fogged it a couple of times.  That may have been a little too much for the roof.  We put 6x6's around the perimeter and screw the legs down to them. That keeps it on the ground when it is windy.  We also screw the bottom of the sides to the 6x6's.  If you buy the side kit for it you have a very inexspensive shelter.  Price vs. Product you can't go wrong.,5.0,Unknown,1,32

"GREED IS A GAME.  PERIOD.: I will say that it's hard to write something like this in today's era; after all, we all decided the truth about Ken Lay and company long long ago, and that makes it hard to read such a book with any kind of objectivity.<br /><br />In spite of this, it's clear that McLean's journey--going way back to her Fortune magazine article questioning Enron's mysteriously inflated value to their eventual demise--shows that her initial suspicion was correct.  The ugliness grows quickly too, as we see certain individuals comforting investors while at the same time selling off their own stocks--all on the same day, no less.  The only thing the book lacked was perhaps a finish line; when we get to the end we hear accounts that this could easily happen again with other corporations, but we're not really shown what we can do as citizens.  Maybe that's not the writer's job, but I feel a sense of disgust in the greed and dishonesty of corporate America and by the end of the book I don't know what to do with it.<br /><br />The question then is evident:  how can a culture prevent such selfish acts when a growing economy is everything and integrity is secondary at best?<br /><br />Until we know that, the problem will only get worse.",4.0,Books,1,7

Fits electric litterbox!: Unexpected events lead to us bringing a second cat into our home.  An old cat who had grown up with other cats she took to it fine.  Our 2 year old cat who had been the only pet in the house prior to this did not take it so well.  We followed every recommendation we could find and made very little very slow progress.  Our youngest cat was stressed and skittish but also frequently harassed the older cat to try and get her to play.  On top of that our youngest would not use a litter box that the other cat had used.<br />We bought two of these cages and fitted each of them with an rfid reading cat door so each cat could only access one cage.  The cage is big enough to fit an electric litter box at the bottom and the shelves create a place for a cat bed and an extra perch.  This is the best thing we have ever done for our cats.  Our scared cat almost immediately began to be less stressed and she started being affectionate and cuddly like she had been before the new arrival.  The older cat had somewhere she could got if she wanted to sleep and not be bothered.  And best of all they are both using their litterboxes now.  Our vet loved them so much she asked for pictures to show to veterinary students in her classes.,5.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26

"The Theater of Lost Souls: This play presents a very cynical view of the theater which I hope is not true to life. According to a clichéd cynical view, show business is full of egomaniacs who just want to stand in the spotlight. It is all vanity! And when the performer can't stand in the spotlight, he or she self-destructs and becomes a drunk or a drug addict. Certainly this happens but I think the vast majority of theater artists are genuine artists who are seeking to explore their humanity. Most theater artists understand that true adoration comes from a greatness of the soul given life on the stage, and not from a big ego. But Halley Feiffer is more involved in the theater than I am so it troubles me that she should write such a play. I would hope that theater artists would have a lot more insight. Ultimately the theater is about self-actualization and not self-aggrandizement.",5.0,Books,1,7

"This Thing of Ours, by Cammy Franzese: In a nutshell, this is the story of Cammy Franzese's marriage to mobster Michael Franzese and how she lived while he spent eight years in prison. I would say it's really more of an overview, because she doesn't go into any great detail about anything. As Michael has books of his own out about his old mafia life, perhaps she felt that had already been covered. Her point in this particular book seems to be that God wanted her to stick it out with this guy and blessed her because she did.<br />To be honest, I had a difficult time relating to the author. I know she was very young when she fell in love and married this man, but she seemed to be awfully, and may I say willfully, clueless. It's the willful part that makes her a less sympathetic character in my opinion.<br />I want to like this book, because I think the overall message is intended to be positive, and perhaps if I knew more of the story I would like it better, but with the little information the author gives in this particular volume I found it hard to ""get into"" what she is trying to say. The feeling I came away with was that I'm glad it worked out for her, but she - and he - asked for all the trouble they had along the way!<br />I reviewed this book for the booksneeze.com blogger book review program and received a free copy of the book in return for my honest review.

"humanizing Madara: The focus of volume 65 shifts to Sasuke, who revives the 4 previous Hokage in order to decide if he should destroy Konoha or not.  I find Naruto at times to be rich in cultural and historical references and this volume is a good example of that.  We see Madara Uchiha as a human being for the first time.  He's like a ninja version of Darth Vader.  He started out as a good guy, but he tragically turned into a bad guy because he turned to the Dark Side.  Hashirama is cast as the Obi Wan Kenobi to Madara's Vader, except this relationship is more of equals rather than the mentor-apprentice relationship Obi Wan and Anakin had.  The &#34;bro-mance&#34; of Hashirama and Madara also reminded me of Romeo and Juliet, only in the sense that you have two kids who just want to be BFF's but they can't because their families want to kill each other.  Although somewhat cliched, this story fills in the details of the founding of Konoha and just how much Madara contributed to the village.  By the end of Hashirama's compelling tale, we get to hear Sasuke's answer.  The only issue I have with is Orochimaru.  His explanation for his actions seemed a bit difficult to buy into, only because for the most part he has been depicted as scum with no redeeming qualities.  Like the earlier volume with Naruto's parents, I found this flashback highly effective and it made me look forward to volume 66.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Not a great Fitbit alternative: I purchased this fitness band as an alternative to a Fitbit just to see what else is out there. I’ve had a Fitbit charge HR for a few years, and that is what I am used to. This has a great design. I love how it charges with no cords. Really genius. I also really liked the idea of having multiple bands to switch it out when needed. But that’s about all that I really like about it. The app is awful. It crashes whenever I try to search for an update. Sleep tracking has minimal useful information. I woke up in the morning and took it off the charger, it had registered over 200 steps while plugged in overnight. The touch sensitivity to scroll through functions was sad. Very frustrating to try to start a workout. When checking heart rate, the screen would time out before it would get hr about half the time I tried.

"Fun object search (Edit: problem fixed): I recently reduced my review to 2 stars because of a problem, but I submitted a help ticket to G5, they got back to me in just a few days and their fix actually worked. My review is now back to 4. Before when there was a new update to the game you could not skip it and continue to the game, you had to go to the app store and download the update. Unfortunately, I have a Kindle first generation, so the most recent update was incompatible with my device and the app was no longer available in the app store. So I was locked out of the game. I’m not sure what their tech people did, but I was told to reboot my Kindle and try the game again and I was let through and I can play again. I do not think I’ll be able to update the game again on this device, but because of the nature of the game, with an almost unending series of quests and collections, I do not think I will run out of things to do any time soon.<br /><br />I have to say this is the best object search game I've played. It's not just a handful of pages with the same objects to find. Each of the many many pictures has an almost unique set of objects and the game play itself varies considerably. The basic search is a simple list of six objects and as you find them new names display, and of course the order is different every time you play the location of the objects change. Additional modes of play includes a series of silhouettes, finding things in the dark, in pairs and morphing objects. The pictures can also be &#34;cursed&#34; which increases difficulty.<br /><br />The game is a money trap, which a large variety of bonuses that can be purchased with actual money, but you don't actually have to spend any money to advance in the game unlike games like Candy Crush.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

The only thing I'd change is the ability to put the device in other vehicles I own in order to do a diagnostics check. Also, when I'm checking my kid's driving performance, I get a lot of ""Unsafe turn"" notifications.  Now I'm not sure what criteria is used to determine this, but I took the car out for a test drive and I also received the same notifications for my turns and I know how to drive and every turn cannot be made at 2 mph.

"Beware of Scammers: I'm giving the PS4 only 3 stars, not because mine has issues yet, but because it's clearly a rampant problem.<br /><br />It's really nice as a console, but it gets really hot. There are barely any vents, and even when just on idle it's way too hot for a console.<br /><br />I'm also giving it 3 stars for all of the jerks trying to pawn off the PS4 at absurd prices here on Amazon. They go for less on ebay, BY A LOT (sorry for the caps), and will be back to a normal price soon enough. If your rugrat really needs one right away, you should have bought it from Amazon when it was at the normal price. Don't feed the trolls. Let them eat the shipping and re-sale cost. If you really need one, there are people selling for far less than the people trying to jack up the re-sale prices here. In fact, you'll likely get a better unit if you just wait until Sony addresses the heat problems anyways, so paying absurd amounts for a beta level product is just stupid.<br /><br />I've personally added the re-sellers that are trying to sell at absurd prices here, to my do-not-buy-from list.

"I love his books: An incredible book by Sir Anthony Beevor. I love his books. I have never believed that Patton's 3rd Army &#34;saved the day&#34;, and the FACTS in this book prove this. It was a huge TEAM  effort by mostly American soldiers and pilots, who held out against all expectations. The 82 and 101st Airborne are in this book of course, but Beevor also salutes the unsung heroes of the battle, the engineers, many other companies and Divisions.<br />The miscommunication by Hitler's Generals, plus Hitler's idiotic micromanaging, as usual, really hurt them. The Germans fought hard, and are excellent soldiers, although of course I do not agree with their cause. Many of the German soldiers did not either!<br />As usual, France is basically worthless, (except for The Underground and General Leclerc late in the war), and someone should have yanked British General Montgomery out of the fray before the disastrous &#34;Market Garden&#34;, as the Battle of the Bulge may not have happened if that debacle had not taken place. What a silly arrogant man. And also, a pedophile (very hush hush). Bradley is fine but prone to pouting, Patton is overrated and a showboat like Monty, and Eisenhower was the PERFECT choice to oversee these men. My head would have exploded, but Eisenhower keeps his cool ( in public).<br /> I did not know much about evil German General Joachim Pieper, but at least I know he eventually got what he deserved. As I CAN read German, but not French, the names of the little Belgian towns I had not heard of slowed me down a bit; but this book is a MUST READ if you want the COMPLETE STORY. My Great Uncle Charles fought in the battle of the Bulge, and he had been born in Germany! But my Father's family loved America. This amazing book will not disappoint!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Is this a Cousteau tribute....absolutely!!: We travelled on wet autumn night to see this movie, not sure what to expect. We were drawn by the cast and its unfavourable reviews and as is so typical with unfavourable reviews, we loved it.<br /><br />I am not going to review the acting or the directing or its production value, since they are but a sideshow to the incredible way Wes Anderson has given us a truly respectful satire of the life of Jacques Cousteau.<br /><br />To present a movie such as this, and call it another Bill Murray comedy is really an insult.  From its Red Knitted Hats, to cheesy uniforms and retro, clunky old equipment, it shows the ""behind-the-scenes"" life of a famous naturalist from the golden era of armchair exploration.  As was so typical of Cousteau, there was more drama behind the scenes than in his documentaries, which eventually took a backseat to his real life.  Anderson shows this by mimicing Cousteaus production styles in the ""docu-features"" shown in the movie, which are bad on purpose, to the stop motion sea creatures which are all fantastic and completely unbelievable.  But the drama onboard the Belafonte no doubt was pretty typical when compared to the Calypso, Cousteau's real ship.<br /><br />Zissou is completely dysfunctional, except for the support of his estranged wife and his band of sycophantical crew.  What a terrific interpration of the real Cousteau.  A man with a dream to show us the oceans, a true eccentric, right down to the illegitemate son and the tragic loss of some of the crew.  And while it certainly is satirical, Cousteau's inability to be a loving father (yet having two complete families at the same time and one not knowing the other!!) is echoed when Bill Murray says to Owen Wilson ""I don't like fathers, so I never wanted to be one.""<br /><br />An under-rated masterpiece of satire, that maintains the dignity of its subject.  The most original and enjoyable movie I have seen in a long, long time.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Hello Kitty...or Not!: I have seen literally hundreds of independently made films written, directed, shot and produced by folks in their living rooms or offices or wherever within the context of film festival faire.  I've seen a lot of bombs and plenty of crowd pleasers.  This one was a crowd pleaser although I detected a little bit of a rip-off from Firefly and possibly some other pop culture iconography. But, hey! There are no new ideas under the sun especially when you get past a certain age.  This particular sci-fi ditty did have it's own spin on the surprise passenger which is what makes it worth watching. Certain threads were relatively cliche. But I've lived a long time so everything often seems that way to me.  The film itself is well directed and photographed although the acting is a touch forced at times. That really gives it a 3.5, but I don't see half a star on my rating chart. So lucky for the Shumway bros that I cut people some slack due to my age when it comes to plots and scripts.  They got a 4 for the candy coated popcorn, peanuts and surprise at the end.  I liked it so give it and their surprise Four Stars.  It's worth the time to watch. At least the 40 plus minutes it took out of my already shortened existence was not a waste. Hopefully you'll watch it and decide for yourself upon its own merits.",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Great product, but need to know how to use: This is my first wet-apply screen protector and I love it. While it does seem to be a bit more of a hassle than my friends' dry-apply screen protectors, it lasts much longer and doesn't affect brightness and colors nearly as much.<br /><br />The ""self healing"" works awesome. A small gouge can be rubbed a bit and will probably disappear entirely by morning. Worst case, remove and re-apply should smooth everything back out. Also, I have a huge scratch in my phone from before I bought the ArmourSuit, and I literally can't see it when the ArmourSuit is installed, but it's extremely obvious with the ArmourSuit removed.<br /><br />Some tips:<br />When positioning originally, be VERY VERY careful to center it exactly. As it starts to dry, watch for ""bubbles"" immediately along the edges, especially the top and bottom edge, as these are places that it could get caught and try to peel back while sliding the phone into your pocket.<br /><br />If it does peel back and get lint/dirt stuck to the sticky side, just remove it and clean it while wet. I've found water can be used in a pinch, but it's best to use the spray that comes with it. When wet, the sticky side isn't sticky and you should be able to gently rub off the fibers, lint, and other ugliness that's stuck to it (Don't rub too hard or you'll rub off the sticky stuff!). If I don't have time to fully remove it (remember it needs to dry over night), I just wet the edge that lifted and keep it out of my pocket until dry.<br /><br />Pay attention to how you slide it in your pocket. I'm not so good at centering, so I just leave a bit of overhang on the top edge when I apply. If I slide my phone in top down, that edge will catch and peal back the screen protector. But if I slide my phone in bottom edge first, there's no problem at all. If you didn't perfectly center above, just mind the sloppy edges when you pocket the phone.<br /><br />If you're doing something that might cause sweat (biking, working out, etc) be careful what else in in your pocket. A little bit of moisture can leave a credit card stuck to the screen protector, and if you're not careful when you remove it, might peel up the screen protector. (this is true for dry-type protectors, too, but those often need to be discarded after that happens.) I make sure the screen of my phone is against my leg when I'm working out and then nothing can stick to it.<br /><br />The ""applicator spray"" that it comes with it used to be for sale on their website, but I don't see it anymore. I'm pretty sure it's just eye glasses cleaner like you can get in much larger quantity for cheap/free from an optical shop. I've fully removed the screen protector and reapplied only 3 or 4 times in 1.25 years of ownership. The last 2 times I used standard eye glasses cleaner and it's been fine. I expect this will last me another year",5.0,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,1,9

"I was at work: And I was telling myself that there must be something better than this.  I was looking for a book that would act a personal coach, help me to identify both the mental and physical obstacles that keep me from finding work that engages more of who I am.  I was looking at Amazon and clicking through the career counseling books when I came across ""The Pathfinder.""  The description of the book and the customer comments made it sound like it would provide the interactive approach I was looking for.<br /><br />Now that I've read it I can tell you that I found it useful but not transformational.  The author would say that I wasn't ready for the transformation.  That may be true but I still think the book could have been better.  My biggest complaint is that the exercises consisted of making lists.  This can be useful for some things but when its applied to everything, it feels redundant and simplistic.  I also found the tone condescending and overly positive.  I finished the book feeling like I'm not enough of a go-getter to have the career I want.  I think  that the right audience for the book is sales and marketing people who love networking and making lists!  The sections on figuring out your personality type and networking seemed very superficial and cobbled together from other career advice books.<br /><br />On the plus side, it deals with some of the mental and emotional obstacles that make change difficult.  In particular, it identified the the fears that masquerade as ""being realistic"" as ""yeah buts.""  These are all the negative responses to attempts to do something new.  ""I could go back to school,  Yeah but, it would be too expensive.""  For me, these are the most powerful stumbling blocks and the book doesn't try to minimize their power or their role as keeping one from committing career suicide or going into massive debt.  However, the book does give some useful suggestions for how to cope with them.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book was helpful in making me realize that I'm engage in a lengthy process that can't be shortened by reading one book no matter how good it is.  My advise to you and myself is that if you want to change your life, take a big risk.  Its not enough to just read about doing it.",3.0,Books,0,7

Started strong.....: But didn't last long. I purchased the Husqvarna toy weed eater for my grandson. He absolutely loved it - played with it every day/all day - basically just carrying it around with the button pressed (he loved the sound). One day it was dead so my son-in-law replaced the batteries....it doesn't work. Two and a half months of working is totally unacceptable in my opinion - especially given the price I paid.,2.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,0,25

Awesome: MCC has created an awesome and very special album with Shooting Straight In The Dark.  She really comes into her own on this one.  Every song is terrific!  If you want to experince MCC's best album this is it.  After this one I recommend State of the Heart and Stones In The Road.  Avoid Come On Come On -- it is very over rated with a few good songs (especially He Thinks He'll Keep Her) but very very mediocre overall.  Every song on SSITD is a winner and is totally enjoyable from start to finish.  Highly Recommended!,5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

Was Park Ranger in that area...accurate setting as to be expected since one of the author's hails from that part of the Great Southwest Desert.  Good mystery, suspense, adventure, well-developed multi-phase backstories.  Well worth reading...Movie proposed ostensibly with Sanda Bullock but am sorry it never saw the screen.  Pretty sure a new ready will really 'get into it' if they like science adventure expedition mysteries in remote harsh environments.

"Helps substantiate the Millerite Movement of 1840-44, Bitter Disappointment 10/22/1844 not due to error of time calculations: The Bible, like other ancient histories, is relatively vague on dating even important events such as the Exodus and when the 3rd decree, giving permission for the exiled Jews to return and begin rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem, was made effective.  Counting the ascension year of a king or beginning with his 2nd year ( first 'full' year) are 2 different ways of counting years of a king's reign; and different cultures Israel encountered influenced their reckoning of time.  The various dating methods used by Egypt, Babylon, and other countries are covered.  This work, helps the student of Bible prophecy date accurately the time of the vital 3rd decree by Artaxerxes in the fall of the Jewish Year 457 B.C.  Then adding 2300 full years (Dan. 8:14) yields the correct date for the beginning of the Investigative judgement of Dan. 7: 9-14; Dan. 8:13,14; & Mal 3:1) when our High Priest, Jesus Christ, entered the last phase of His intercession for sinful humanity in the Most Holy Place of the Heavenly Sanctuary above.  This final phase of Christ's ministry is drawing to a close ( Dan. 11:40-45 thru 12:3; Rev. 10; 22).  From the fall of A.D. 1 extends 457 full years to the fall of 457 B.C.  there remains 2300-457 = 1843 full years from fall of A.D. 1 which extends to the fall of 1844 when the Millerite or Adventists proclaimed the 2nd coming of Christ.  Their reckoning of the prophetic times where first shown to be in error after the earlier Spring or 'Great Disappointment"" of March 21, 1844 when the period of one year expired ( Mar. 21, 1843 to same date in 1844) for the expected 2nd Coming of Christ was first calculated by Mr. William Miller, supposing a Jewish Year beginning in the Spring.  None of the opponents/ critics/ mockers discovered this error either.  But later in the summer of 1844,  corrections by Samuel Snow, showing that the decree of Artaxerxes was made effective in the fall and not at the beginning of the year 457 B.C. were proven to be correct and extended the expected date to Oct. 22, 1844 on the antitypical Jewish Day of Atonement.  However their expected event was still not correct.  They held the popular view at the time that the world was the sanctuary of the new covenant times and that the cleansing foretold in Dan. 8:14 was referring to the cleansing fires of the earth at the 2nd coming of Christ.  Further study, showed their error, and they learned the truth, largely from the book of Hebrews, of the existence of the heavenly sanctuary ( Heb. 8-9:12 'ta hagia' - rendered more properly: the holies or holy places or heavenly sanctuary) where Christ went to minister on man's behalf in A.D. 31 upon His ascension to heaven.  The Greek cited does not indicate that Christ went directly into the Most Holy Place in A.D 34-- a view which reflects a bias by the NIV translators,  but that He did enter that Apartment for the first time in A.D. 1844 to begin the closing work of the Plan of Salvation which includes forgiveness of sins that occured under his previous ministry in the Holy Place or 1st compartment of the heavenly sanctuary.  There is a special work to take place among Christ's true followers on earth- to correspond with Christ's closing work in the Heavenly Most Holy Place- which involves repentance from sin, including the restoration of the true Bible Sabbath on the 7th day of the week.",5.0,Books,1,7

The primer and paint worked well (I sprayed with a hobby type spray pen). The application of the clear coat (also sprayed) immediately turned the surface white (brilliant silver was the paint color). After it dried, the surface was chalk like and could be wiped away with some of the paint. I repainted and waited 24 hours to ensure the paint was dry and tried the clear coat again with the same results. It appears the clear coat reacts with the paint and slightly dissolves it. The instructions provided with the kit and on the website are less than adequate. Not happy that I spent a lot of time for a bad result.",2.0,Automotive,0,4
"A good product with a major design flaw (and a minor design flaw): As far as cooking goes; this is a perfectly find multi purpose cooker.  Anything you could do with a slow cooker, a rice cooker, or a food steamer you could do with this.<br /><br />There is one significant issue and one minor issue.  The significant issue is that the lid is not removeable.  This can be moderately annoying for cooking or serving, based on personal preference, but is ultimately not a major issue in that regards.  The problem is when its time to clean it.  Since you can't remove the lid, you have to clean it while its still attached to the cooker.  Not a terrible issue.  But, the lid has an internal vent... control, I guess.  Its a small rotating plastic thing underneath the steam vent.  Presumably its there to limit bubbling.  Food easily gets trapped underneath it and as it is not (as far as I can tell) removeable, its not possible to clean properly.<br /><br />The best solution I've found is to run water both across the underside of the lid and down the steam vent, and honestly I'm considering removing the plastic thing simply because I doubt the benefit is worth the hassle.  The rest of it can be cleaned with wiping which again isn't terribly bad, its just awkward since you have to wipe it down while its still attached.  Fortunately the hinge is not in a position to be in contact with the food so standard outside cleaning is fine for that.  Still, overall it means that cleaning is a hassle and you can't really be sure you've properly cleaned everything.  The pot itself is very easy to clean, but the lid and the associated food safety issues really knocked down the cleaning score.<br /><br />The second issue is that its difficult to remove the pot from the cooker when the pot is still hot.  This may be more of a personal thing, because I tend to cook rice in significant quantities and then refrigerate it for quick use later, but what I normally do with rice cookers is remove the pot and simply pour the rice directly into whatever I'm storing it in.  Naturally, I need something insulated to hold it.  Its not really viable to do that because of how close fitting the pot is; you just can't get a decent grip on it unless you're using your hands.  This only dropped the score a little because its just a minor convenience gripe that probably doesn't event apply to everyone, but I thought I would include it because it is a bit annoying to me.<br /><br />Overall; its not nearly bad enough to return it, but when I'm looking for a new rice cooker I'm definitely going to be shopping around instead of just getting a replacement.",3.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

"Pretty bright 4 pk solar lights: 4 pk Solar Lights<br />The lights came well packaged and each light was individually wrapped in a bubble wrap pouch.  Kit came with screws and a little plastic mounting circle in case you’d prefer mounting the lights on a fence or wall.  If you want to place them in the ground plastic spikes were provided.  Each light is shaped like a thick plastic sprocket design.  Button to turn lights on is on the back of each light and was easy to get light in the ON position and then change it to the setting I wanted by gently pressing the button again.  Lights seem like they are well sealed from the elements.<br />When placing lights into the ground with the plastic spikes I found since I have rock in my landscaping it was easier to do a “pilot hole” with a pair of scissors to make it easier to place the plastic spike into.  Tried it first without and felt like the pressure needed to get it into the ground would break the spike.<br />3 of the 4 lights were working out of the box.  Hoping the 4th light just needs sunlight to charge it up.  4th light wasn’t quite as bright as the other 3 lights last evening but was giving off some light.

"Works great and saves me time and frustration: I purchased this so that I could monitor the PH levels in my hydroponic system easily, rather than pulling out the testing kit and taking a sample several times a day. It worked so well just for monitoring, I decided to get a pump to automatically add either ph up or down. You can only choose one, but I found that my system likes to drop below 5.9, so I mainly use ph up to keep it between 6.0 and 6.2. I didn't use the Milwaukee pump for $80, however. I got a generic $12 pump and used an old mobile phone charger for power. Works great and I no longer have to make quick adjustments to keep it in range. I no longer wake up on the morning to a ph pf 5.1 :)",5.0,Industrial_and_Scientific,1,19
"Mediocre at best.  Many minor complaints.: I bought this kit (First Responder EMT EMS Trauma Bag Stocked First Aid Fill Kit B) to keep in my truck while hauling our RV.  Accidents happen, maybe to us, maybe to others on the road.  So I wanted to be prepared.<br /><br />Concerns:<br /><br />1.  The bag is smaller than I would have hoped.  Not terrible - it'll hold some basics, but a small backpack would likely do the job just as well, or better.<br /><br />2.  It feels like many of the included products would not be on my first aid list (100 plain Curad bandages), while others are not present and seem like they maybe should be.<br /><br />3.  The kit includes 4 nitrile gloves in a cardboard envelope and a few ""KN95"" masks that had some ridiculous saying on them like ""Closer to the heart.  The flowers lift the spirit.""  I left them out of the kit and now can't find them to give the exact quote.  The point is - the masks suddenly seemed less medical and reliable.<br /><br />4.  The included stethoscope was damaged and it was packaged in a cardboard box - so presumably would not have been exposed to much force.  Maybe in the factory?  I can't be bothered to try to get it replaced or fixed.<br /><br />5.  Zippers run very rough.  I'll not be surprised if they fail with some use.<br /><br />In sum - this bag full of mid-grade products might, if the stars align, save a life or manage a crisis.  However, you may be better off (especially if you have some medical knowledge or good GoogleFu) to buy a backpack and the supplies you believe belong in your kit.  If you have no idea, and just want a pretty good shot at having what you need in a pinch, this kit will likely do OK.",2.0,Health_and_Household,0,16

Great read!: Others have compared this book to Shades of Gray - but I find that the story is different enough and the writing much better than that - it is a story of love surviving despite the demons that may have haunted us in the past. It was an engrossing read. The only disturbing thing was the nickname of &#34;Precious&#34; used by a male figure. I thought the author made a mistake there - since it automatically made me think of Lord of the Rings and not in a good way. But other than that - good read.,5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

Second; since the light is very diffuse and the arms that hold the light out from the base are too short the light only illuminates the first 12 inches of the painting, and the rest is way under lite. Also the transformer could have been attached to the plug of the cord so the housing could have been made much smaller.

"The Big Reveal: I found this film to be quite revealing. Little is really known about the man who currently occupies The White House. We know all about George W Bush and we know the history of Mitt Romney. How is it that so little is known about Barack Hussein Obama?<br /><br />This film explains a great deal about Barack Obama. It illustrates how and why there came to be so much we don't know about this man. Shockingly, it explains that Frank Marshall Davis is the real father of Barack Obama and how and why his grandfather had to hide this fact from his employer.<br /><br />Frank Marshall Davis was a poet, an avid photographer and a Marxist. We see How Frank Davis came to know a young girl who rebeled against her father and how this rebellion ended in her pregnancy. We are shown how the details of this relationship were obscured.<br /><br />This film shows the influence that Frank Marshall Davis, as well as others, had on Barack Obama's political beliefs.

Then I left it outside and it got sunburnt! My fiddle leaf was pissed and it stopped growing in the middle of summer when last year it grew like a weed! I decided to treat it to some niceties including fiddle leaf soil, fertilizer and this pot. I had looked everywhere for a 14” pot with the drainage I wanted, and I know I’m new to gardening but I had a tough time. Finally I bought this one and I’m so happy I did. My fiddle leaf is growing again! The picture doesn’t do it justice since I temporarily moved it closer to the window and took the pic in bad lighting, but it looks so good with my other room decor.",5.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,1,25

4.5 stars: The Forgotten Ones by Steena Holmes is a compelling contemporary story with a touch of mystery to it. The book is mainly told from the point of view of two of the characters Elle and David. There are also flashes back into the past that are done by the stories that David tells of those days.<br /><br />The only family that Elle had ever known was her mother who is struggling with her mental health. With the help of a caregiver Elle has been able to go to school and get a job working at the hospital which happens to be the same hospital that the elderly David lies while waiting for his disease to take him.<br /><br />David’s nurse has helped him write letters to his daughter and granddaughter in hopes that the poor man will not have to die alone. When Elle receives the letter from David she’s quite taken aback finding that her grandfather has been alive her whole life but yet she’s never known. Wanting to find out more about her family Elle decides to visit David when he requests to tell her the story in which Elle hopes to find the answers she’s always wanted.<br /><br />The Forgotten Ones is a story for those that just love peeling back the layers to a family drama and searching for the answers while sorting through the secrets and lies. With wonderful writing and a completely engaging story I found this one incredibly hard to put down as I waited to find the answers to the mystery of the past that David slowly unveiled. The only reason I marked this down to 4.5 stars was I had a sneaking suspicion about a certain detail but overall this was a wonderful story that I think readers will be sure to be captivated by.<br /><br />I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.,5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Building the dark dynasty: This is the kind of storytelling where we move forward while barely gaining a inch.<br /><br />The main thing happening in this book is the development of Judas and Rhia's relationship.<br />Do we get much more? No. Well perhaps a bit. Am I complaining? Hell no. I am loving every second of this twisted, toxic, and fated relationship. Savage Gods is undoubtedly setting this couple up for an epic conclusion in Vicious Dynasty.<br /><br />I love this couple. Rhia is learning some hard truths but remains struggling in the dark about everything that is going on. But she has enough fight to not be a doormat and go toe to toe with Judas. Judas is a true non-apologetic, dark anti-hero. They are well developed characters and their chemistry is bar none. The dramatic suspense, mystery and intrigue has me hooked. I'll admit I'm a little nervous but mostly excited to see how this plays out. Waiting with baited breath for the conclusion of this riveting trilogy!<br /><br />I received an ARC and I am leaving a review voluntarily. Opinions are my own.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Great oil for tick repellent.....has worked great on my dog.: I ordered the oil as a tick repellant for my dog and so far it has worked wonderfully. Since he already suffered with Lyme several years ago, I needed to find a natural way for him to be safe when he's outside. I could never watch him suffer that badly again. Luckily, he has healed completely, but this oil can now keep him safe so we can enjoy the outdoors again. So, I am grateful that this product is made so well and has worked incredibly well at repelling ticks. Since using it, we have not found a single tick on my dog. I highly recommend this oil for it's many uses, but most especially for repelling ticks. I do have to comment on the rose aroma.....if you like roses you will love the smell of this oil. I found it to be a bit too powerful so I spray my dog in the outside hall, but for the way it helps him, I would tolerate the flowery smell for the rest of my life. If you have a dog that enjoys being outside, buy  this oil and mix it with water in a spray bottle.....when you go outside simply spray his legs, his tail and the back.of his neck...it's that simple. You can also spray yourself and your kids as a means to avoid ticks. It's worth every penny to help avoid tick and that dreadful Lyme disease.",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Where Love Comes to Die: Where love comes to die.<br /><br />Several years ago I attempted to watch this film and couldn't make it to the first madrigal.  I'm not kidding.  Bored early this morning I decided to give it another shot and an entirely different reaction took place:  overwhelmed.  I've had a lifelong love of all things Monteverdi and the madrigal books were amongst the first works of his I fell for.  Hard.  The idea of setting Monteverdi's Fourth Book of Madrigals (complete) to a lip-synched film of modern couples breaking up in a posh London restaurant somehow just did not feel ""right."" This time through however, I got exactly what director John La Bouchardiere felt when he thought this a great idea for a short (hour long) film.<br /><br />While it isn't necessary to have visualizations for Monteverdi's grand excursion into love and loss to make their point - the music and word settings make their point(s) beautifully sans pictures, La Bouchardiere nonetheless achieves something beautiful and manages to capture the heartbreak by sharing the breakups of six couples occuring simultaneously in a single night.<br /><br />Through the use of changing camera lenses, lighting, filters and various techniques (most notably cineme verite) and brief flashback sequences, we see the couples loving and losing.  We see them on camping trips, christenings, post love making (discretely, no nudity here) and feel their sense of elation and doom - all of which somehow gracefully compliment Monteverdi's difficult, often stunning harmonizations and beautifully sung polyphony.  The richness of his a capella score, lays wide open the naked emotions with an often brutal power that LaBouchardiere captures with a sure and natural sense of timing, knowing where to place and leave his cameras, when to cut to a flashback, where to allow the reaction shots - all of it flowing in seamless rhythm with the music.<br /><br />The vocal ensemble I Fagiolini, paired with silent actors make up the entire cast all of whom hold the hour long film together as if their lives depended upon it.  I Fagiolini approach the music powerfully and often full voiced as opposed to the delicacy frequently heard from many other early music groups.  The result is an often thrilling (and raw) soundscape of theatricality unique in this style of music.  The ""sighing"" quality so necessary in this music is not eliminated by such an approach but rather becomes a highlight because of the more complex dynamics and shadings of the ensemble.  They're simply wonderful.<br /><br />I can imagine many (most?) might feel the same as I did when first trying to watch this, but - if you've got an hour and can open your heart to some of the most exquisite music ever written to being performed - to being the ""script"" for an oddly beautiful film, I strongly recommend this gem of a movie.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22
"Works, but do not recommend for Presta valve: This pump is bad at presta valve inflation.<br /><br />I was able to convert it from Schrader, that wasn't too hard... although I had to slightly stretch the spring in removing it.<br /><br />When using for presta: The sealing part is miss-sized (it fits too tightly) making it physically quite hard to put on-and-off the valve. When inflating pressures above 90psi, the pump is hard to push down, and tends to wobble under force. The final problem is when removing the pump from the valve after inflation, the miss-sized seal in the head is difficult to pull off the valve, and lots of air leaks out. While this pump works, I do not recommend it.",2.0,Unknown,0,32

"Great start to the series!: I will start by saying I do not usually read time travel Sci-fi type books, but this book really pulls you in. Right from the beginning there is always something going on. It is an emotional roller coaster ride for you as you read, it is great. With constant turns it kept me on the edge of my seat. Another aspect that I loved was the two main characters! Oh my goodness, they were adorable! The characters overall were great. They were well developed and had unique qualities to them. Rhonda was able to portray them so you fall in love, or hate, with the character. It really ensures you want to continue reading the next book in the series.<br /><br />  With a Hunger Games type vibe from the end of the book, I would recommend this book.

If this is you and you're looking for some actual techniques that you can USE, you'll find this one a definite help.  Written by a writer who leaps genres and delivers more reliably than the Fed EX guy, you can tell this is written by someone who really knows what they're talking about.

An Excellent Read....: Just finished reading this last night. It was very well written; few errors and nothing jarring. The story line followed very logically - even going back and forth from present day to the Ninth Century. If the author did real research; then I learned a lot about the early Church with all the politics and machinations. Some of which I already knew having been educated in the Catholic School system in NYC. Very interesting characters. I am going to look up the author to see if he wrote a followup book - he could easily do so with the characters if he so chooses.,5.0,Books,1,7

Try as I might, the pushing, twisting, and re-seating them only served to further hurt my ears. That's a non-starter from which I cannot give them a good testing and review.<br />(Have since tried two other brands and there's no pain at all and the others don't fall out and one of them has incredible noise-cancelling.

"Great bag, steal of a price!: I loved this travel tote!  I was looking for something about this size that I could check on and not worry about it or my things getting damaged.  Although it wasn't quite as sturdy of a fabric I wished (allowing me to pack anything I wanted in there without worrying that it would break inside), it did exactly its job and traveled throughout Europe being tossed and checked without a hitch!  It looks really cool and vintage too.  My mom had bought me an expensive bag from Nordstrom which I returned opting for this one.  It just looked cooler.

"Fun, exciting, and such a lot of good reading.: These books are written by the the view of Max the cat.  He is an adorable cat with his quirky side.

"Uncomfortable and poorly fit for my ears: Look... I don't WANT to write a bad review here... But when I look back on my experience with these things, it's hard to remember anything good.<br /><br />My biggest issue with these were the fit. The way the over-ear part set around my ear made it feel like they were constantly trying to get free. They didn't like to set in place and get with the program. With earbuds, they have to set right and have a good seal on your ear to have good sound quality. These just didn't want to.<br /><br />That all being the case, the sound quality suffered big time.

"A great standalone of a trilogy that did not leave me confused!: I was given this in exchange for an honest review. I haven't read any of the other of the Forbidden Novels, so I was figuring out things as I went. It worked out well because the author actually covered everything in detail so I wasn't lost...I couldn't even tell it was part of a trilogy (I didn't know until after I read it)! Ransom and Dani met in a bar and it wasn't the typical type of hook-up. She was shy and didn't exactly know what she was doing while he was way more experienced and drunk as a skunk! There was a lot of foreplay, but the sex didn't come right away; it was a nice change because in some the foreplay is quick and sex is the main part of the story. This is more of a dealing with issues type of novel. I really enjoyed reading it because there is usually a lot of drama in a relationship (on both sides) that isn't dealt with in books. He was acknowledging that he has a drinking problem and she is helping him to deal with it, as well as the issues he has with his twin brother. In the end, Ransom and Dani are able to work out their relationship at the speed and satisfaction to them both. I highly recommend this book and I am going to go back and read the previous books in the trilogy!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Artists, before you give up your hopes and dreams, please read.: I have been singing, dancing and acting for as long as I can remember. A teacher of singing and dancing for over 10 years.  During beginning of the pandemic, I purchased this book after discovering I have a chronic condition that affects my voice. I read it at a time when both my physical and mental health was at an all time low. I was ready to quit my love of singing and teaching before I had even really allowed myself the chance to see what I was even capable of.<br /><br />I began on a journey to ""FIX,"" myself so that my voice would be perfect again. That journey involved many medications that didn't work, invasive tests that were inconclusive and the next step was a very dangerous and expensive surgery with a high failure rate and thank goodness I didn't go down that path.<br /><br />This book was a stepping to stone to helping me to discover who I truly was and could potentially be. With the support of family and my two best friends, the inspiration from this book I decided to go down an unconventional path.<br /><br />Instead I decided to invest in lessons and courses with the author who helped me do the work that I needed to do to realise that I already was enough, perfectly imperfect. My condition has not magically disappeared but it does not define who I am or dictate my value and worth as a singer and teacher even when my voice misbehaves.<br /><br />So yes this book is amazing, funny, inspiring and I can't wait for the next one but I guess the review is really about the author and what she offers the world in so may other ways.<br /><br />Thank you Kim for giving me a permission slip and stepping stone to realise that I am not broken.",5.0,Books,1,7

"His Billionaire Bride: Uniquely original and beautifully written.  I couldn’t get enough of Carrie and Edwin.<br /><br />Carrie and Edwin were as different as night and day.  Together, they had a love so strong, everyone around them could feel it.  Carrie was afraid to love because she feared losing someone, so she put a time limit on relationships.  Edwin just wanted someone to love forever.  He was done with temporary relationships. When Carrie’s sister hires Edwin to paint a bride on the side of her building, she wants Carrie to be the model.  Carrie refuses to wear a wedding dress, but Edwin had a way of convincing her to do it.  There was just something about him that could make anyone relax and let down their guard.  From there, the romance builds and it was heartbreaking knowing it would end after only two weeks.  I couldn’t wait to see how the author would turn the story around and give them a happily ever after.<br /><br />This book was so good, I wasn’t ready for it to end, but I was happy to see Carrie and Edwin come together.  I wasn’t sure what to think when Edwin’s secret came out, but it added a lot more depth to the story.  At the end, I couldn’t help but get emotional.  It was like watching a scene in a movie that you need a big box of tissue just to get through it.  This book is the second in the Morgan Sisters series and can be read on its own, but I would recommend reading The Wedding Obsession first so you an get a good feel for the sisters.

Wonderful product: I am thrilled with the quality of this product. I was worried about the tuner on the radio but it tuned to the FM station that I listen to perfectly and it came in very clearly. I tried the record player and CD player. The sound quality is very good. And I did not realize it even had a tape player so I was excited about that also. For the price it is perfect. I am very pleased. I like to listen to old records so I think this was a great purchase.,5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Survived Hurricane Ike - 8 Days with No Power, BUT I HAD THIS LIGHT!: UPDATED REVIEW:<br /><br />Bought this in January and it must have been prophetic.  By September, in rolled Hurricane Ike and knocked my tree limbs down and my power out for 8 days!<br /><br />This was our choice light for bathing/brushing teeth at nighttime.  In dark bathrooms, this crank light came in incredibly handy!  Instead of only having limited viewable space, like that of a flashlight, this light flooded the entire bathroom with light making things like flossing teeth possible.  We just carried this thing around by the neck and it worked out just fine!<br /><br />We also got major usage out of the ""nightlight"" feature, which stayed illuminated throughout the entire nights, but it did dim down over the many hours and would need another little crank before daybreak to keep it going.  It is an ENORMOUS comfort to have a small light going all night, if nothing else, to keep you from tripping while going to the bathroom.  Also, it is comforting knowing that the little light won't burn down the house, like a candle could.<br /><br />We never used any of the other features on this light because we already had other devices that had those same features, but I can tell you, I believe this baby is worth the price, just for the lantern and nightlight.<br /><br />The best recommendation can only come from experience and from my experience, this was a real lifesaver and got just as much use by me and hubby as any flashlight did.",4.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"Perfect for use with ""lipstick"" sized, ultra-compact battery from Ankers - fits Apple's leather case for iPhone 5: The answer to the million dollar question:  Yes, the lightning connector on this cable does fit through the opening of the leather Apple case for the iPhone 5s without any DIY modification required.  I bought this for my wife to use with her iPhone 5s along with an Ankers Astro Ultra-Compact battery/charger, and I was afraid before I received the shipment that this cable would not fit the iPhone 5s with the Apple case in place -- at least without having to sand down the cable's connector.  But as it turns out, the cable fits perfectly through the apple case's opening without any modification required.  It's small/short enough for my wife to just leave in her purse with the extra charger and forget about it until she needs to use it.<br /><br />The quality is very good -- the cable appears to be very well made.

"Looks like it would only fit hardhats that have a full brim:: This item was depicted as a flashlight mount kit that could fit a firefighters helmet but took the chance that it could fit a construction hardhat.<br /><br />I'm not saying dont buy it.  Don't get me wrong.  I dont thing there is a cheaper flashlight that takes the CR123A batteries.  However, this flashlight DOES NOT take the 18650 batteries as the inside of the housing is too small.<br /><br />But the bracket does fit the Streamlight ProTac HL-X which, I believe, one of the best flashlights on the market that utilizes dual fuel, a CR123A or a 18650 battery, that provides much better voltage than standard AA or AAA or any alkaline batter has to offer.<br /><br />But if you on a budget, this may be for you.

"Started using this after being visited by the ghost of Wilford Brimley: I started using this product after I was visited by the ghosts of Wilford Brimley past, present, and future.  While in college I had gained a ton of weight and had ballooned up the the size of a hippopotamus.  The weight gain really didn't bother me until I was told that I was at the upper edge of the Pre-Diabetic scale (Hence the visits from the ghosts of Wilford Brimley).  After getting the news, and being afraid of imploding into myself like a neutron star, I decided to engage in what I called ""The Great Unfattening of 2020"".  Overnight I cut out ALL added sugar from my diet, and cut down on refined carbs as well.  I incorporated the Slim Fast Diabetic Weight Loss shake into my daily meal plan and in 6 months I lost 80 pounds, no joke.  The thing I like about this shake is that it actually tastes OK.  A lot of other weight loss shakes taste like ""Failure, Regret, and the expression Meh"" all rolled into one product, but not this one, it doesn't suck so bad. Anyway, if you want to shed some pounds and lose your three chins so people stop coming up to you and shaking them for good luck, then this is the product for you.",5.0,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,1,14

I also noticed that I was sharper and more focused with whatever I was doing. Surprised how my body immediately was affected by it. I didn't realize how potent it would be and had to look up all the benefits.  Found out it builds muscle, speeds up healing, improves blood flow, reduces stress, sharpens the brain, improves focus - everything that I need! Will surely be taking a dose of it on a daily basis.

Waterproof (but not stiff or noisy fabric) for rainy days and very visible reflective ribbon for night walks. Awesome jacket for the money. I have spent double this on coats from Petsmart and Petco that are not this nice. I would definitely buy this again.

"Excellent Spanish Learning CD for Babies and Kiddos: We are trying to be a bilingual household (husband grew up in bilingual household though we speak mostly english in ours). I'm the non-native speaker but minored in spanish in college, so it's important to me that our child grows up bilingual but also speaks proper spanish, not just spanglish! We're only about 6 months in but our child is already showing interest in music so I thought kid's songs in spanish would be a great way to start introducing spanish more into our everyday routine. I've picked up a few CDs that the music was either too fast, songs were too long, or the spanish wasn't easy to repeat. This CD is the opposite- the songs are catchy without being annoying, they are short enough to hold interest, have easy to sing along with melodies, and the spanish is very clear and easy to sing along with. In fact, after playing the CD only twice in the car while running errands, I already have several of the songs memorized enough to sing along to. The songs are also about everyday activities, like brushing your teeth, eating, getting dressed, etc. so it will be easy for me to sing them to our baby when we are doing those daily activities to help reinforce the spanish. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to introduce spanish to their child. would also be great in a preschool setting where spanish is part of the learning experience. We will definitely buy more spanish music cds from this company. Great job!",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Like the adjustable angle, trackball itself is just okay: I switch between a Logitech M570 (thumb trackball) and a Logitech MX Master 3 (regular mouse) daily, so I couldn’t help but compare the ProtoArc Trackball to the devices I use daily. For me, it’s not a worthy replacement. It’s a backup mouse, or one to take traveling with me when I’m worried my favorite mice might get damaged or lost.<br /><br />I do really like the adjustable angle of the mouse itself. The base allows you to set the mouse at 0 degrees or 20 degrees. That feature drew me to the trackball, and I think it’s implemented well. The mouse is rock steady at 0 or 20 degrees, but it’s easy to switch between the options. And because it’s built in, there are no extra parts to carry or worry about losing. For me, the 20 degree angle feels very natural, and that’s the one thing I miss when I go back to my usual mice.<br /><br />The trackball itself feels sluggish and inconsistent. I’ve tried adjusting the DPI, but that’s not the problem. Sometimes the ball registers the movement of my thumb and sometimes it doesn’t. I did check the ball and sensors; they are clean. The ball is actually hard to pop out, I needed to stick a pen through the small hole to get it out.<br /><br />The left and right click are soft and muted sounding. Which is okay, but then the scroll wheel click is loud in comparison. The scroll wheel has some resistance, it’s like scrolling through quicksand.<br /><br />The mouse charges via USB-C.",3.0,Electronics,0,12

"Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7B review/comparison: Further to the other both objective and subjective reviews, I agree with almost all of the top review points.<br /><br />Please note, I'm also not a true audiophile, but do have a good main system with B&W CDM-9NT's and a SVS sub (that is almost unnecessary with the 9NT's for criticl listening, but shakes the room for movies), both sourced from by a Maranz 7300.  While not headphones, these components provide a foundation for general quality of sound comparison.<br /><br />A few of my thoughts to add to the discussion about comparison of the noise-canceling cans in this range:<br /><br />Sennheiser PXC 450:<br />Comfort is not as good as the AT ATH-ANC75B for my taste.  The overall headphone enclosures were a bit large and the speaker projections inside were sometimes noticeable until I adjusted or remembered to ignore them.  Agree that the noise cancellation did not seem as good as the AT's.  The PCX 450 did provide more accurate reproduction.  For a minor comparison, my other Sennheiser open ear cans and Grados provide better reproduction and sound stage, but they obviously bleed sound to others and do not provide nose cancellation.<br /><br />Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7b:<br />Preferred the fit for my taste.  A little more compact that seemed to fit my ears better and isolated noise better.  Not as sonically accurate as the PXC.  However, I did like the punchier sound quality for my tastes for certain genres of music like rock and pop.  I agree that they have better noise cancellation and isolation and may provide an extra volume boost.  I probably like these the best for my own reasons.  Alas, after owning them over 5 years, the noise cancellation wore out and some of the padding started falling out.  That's what I get for wearing them to sleep so often!  Planning on re-buying a pair, probably the ones listed here, which are on my wish list.<br /><br />Bose QC15:<br />Ok.  I'll admit I am biased against Bose.  Their designs try to appear Hi-Fi, but to do so, they masking some frequencies and emphasizing others.  This may sound cool for a while, but is less desirable for accurate reproduction and it eventually colors all the songs the same way... Like putting the same spice on every food.  I have had a few Bose headphones and speakers and always noticed the coloration.  What is their slogan?  I think it is ""Bose...  Better sales through marketing.""  That being said, I have not tried the QC15 for the above reasons.  A friend of mine has a pair that he likes, but it seems like he likes them because they were a high-end purchase for him.  A lot of other reviews indicate it has good noise cancellation.<br /><br />Like I said, I have the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7B on my wish list to supplement the Sennheiser PXC 450, especially since the price is so much lower than when I originally bought them.  I have the feeling I may use the Audio-Technica more.  Mainly because of the more compact design, mild volume boost, and punchier sound.",5.0,Electronics,1,12
"FANTASTIC!: I had owned the Little Green Clean Machine for about 12 years and it finally died.  Couldn't live without it so had to purchase the Little Green.  I though the original was great but this one blows it away!  The suction is amazing.  I have three dogs and I did my couches with this machine and couldn't believe how wonderful they came out.  The suction was so strong that you don't need to use a lot of pressure to suck out the dirt and water, therefore I didn't have a sore arm the next day.  Wonderful product, great price.  Hope to have this one in my life for the next 12 years!  Makes cleaning fun and rewarding. Next project, the car upholstery!",5.0,Industrial_and_Scientific,1,19

"a Review from an owner.... WOW!: Tremendous value for money,  5 discs... 2 Blu ray and the entire program on 3 DVDs as well.  The legendary Mutual films, plus two documentaries.  Chaplin invented the Tramp at Keystone, began to leave the scoundrel Tramp at Essanay , and his year at Mutual really took his film making and character to the top of the world.  The films are not given the KINO treatment (which means NO treatment).... these are absolutely the best elements from around the world, multiple scores to choose from and other than the silly company logo on each of the newly created Inter Titles..... a revelation.  OH, on the Amazon.com page there is  a short clip... at the end it gives the email address of the company producing them. .... and selling them for 20 bucks less than Amazon.com.  I bought direct and they arrived on the 19th.... and I watched them straight through.  These films contain some of the most iconic images of the legendary Chaplin .... roller skating , or balancing on the boat in the immigrants, and many more. To think these were created 98 years ago.... staggering to have them and in such good shape.  This is about half the price the DVD set alone was that came out several years back..... and at 39 bucks about the price of a single Criterion or KINO BR disc.<br />HIGHLY Recommended.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Very good toilet safety rail but....: With any safety equipment for home use, it must be easy to assemble, stable and sturdy...or it just won't serve its purpose well. This toilet safety rail is pretty good, but I couldn't give it five stars because the design for sturdiness is not quite top notch. This is fine for my mom to use because the force or pressure she puts on the rails isn't enough to put a strain on the product.  However, there is some give outward on the frame arms and so anyone needing to apply a lot of force to support yourself sitting down and getting up from the toilet, should look for a heavy duty product.  There is just no way to tighten the rails/arms of this product so that it could be stiff, like on a walker frame. Nevertheless, the padded arms, adjustable height and fit over the toilet is great...and most importantly, it serves its purpose well for my mom.",4.0,Health_and_Household,1,16
"Will stretch, and conform to your hands profile.: I bought these at costco, 3 pair for under 20 USD. They had them on display and available to try on, and I found a pair that fit my hands, something that is easier said than done. I usually just buy cheap leather gloves from harbor freight, but I got tired of those falling apart, which they did, way to fast. They were also shaped terribly, one finger would hit the end of the finger sleeve while others wouldn't even make it half way up the finger... The leather used on the harbor freight is fine, but the back of the hand, non leather part, would just unravel and fall apart quickly. Anyhow, these all leather gloves are great, at first I thought they were a little snug, but after using them for a day or two, the leather stretches, in a good way, and molds to your hand perfectly.  If they hold up durability wise, I dont think i'll ever buy anything other than these ever again.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30
"Awesome For Focus: I've taken rhodiola supplements several times and always found them to be very effective for increasing focus.  The manner I've experienced this increase in focus as an increase in tolerance to outside stressors.  I'm an entrepreneur with several projects going on at once.  This leads to multiple problems and with levels and sub-levels of severity within each problem.  This rhodiola supplement from Bulk Supplements is the best I've taken for helping me stay in the flow, ie not overreacting to problems and decisions of low severity.  I can't tell you what a blessing it has been to not want to scream at my girlfriend for asking me where I want to go to dinner after a long day of making decision after decision.

"There is a lot to like about using this device: So as a committed pp book readier I had some problems, but you may not. There is a lot to like about using this device. The downloading is quite good although the pages take a little more time to change than I like. The font and contrast is excellent and the reading 'plane' is a plus. So what is bad? Well, for one thing, I can't tell where a chapter ends. Actually, you can if you are willing to learn everything to do it. What else? The pages were short. By that I mean that it only took about twenty seconds to read the page.  This is a big problem for me and the fact that I didn't know when the chapter ended. Why is that important? I guess because I like to know where I am in a chapter. Why? Because I like to know when I should quit reading and save some for the next day. In short, I wish that the darn thing was eight inches instead of six. There is no bad 'thing' to say about this device, but it won't be for everyone. I still order pp books and like to read them. On the other hand, I like the fact that when I am out of story I can dial up a new book. It's a personal thing and you may never find your sweet spot with the device. Some good and some bad.

"A Few Flaws, but still worth it.: Well-designed pack, but has a few flaws that prevent a 5-star rating.<br /><br />The Bad News: As others have mentioned there is a quality issue at hand. The seams are not reinforced very well and the first one I recieved had to be returned for a replacement because the bottle holder mesh fell apart, and the bottle was the perfect size. (Which reminds me, nothing bigger than a standard water bottle will fit in the holder.) In the replacement, I took the liberty of sewing-in my own reinforcement, but I expect higher quality from Kensington.<br /><br />Also, the lumbar adjustments on the back are a clever idea executed badly. When fully loaded, the lumbar tab always pops out of its setting, usually floating somewhere between 2 and 3. Despite that, the bag remains comfortable, but my efforts to fix this problem have thus far been unsuccessful.<br /><br />The Good News: Fits my 15"" laptop beautifully and has plenty of pockets to store cables, cameras and whatnot. For university use, I recommend putting books in the main compartment (though be careful not to overload it) and notebooks in the secondary compartment. Pencils. pens, and hilighters sit perfectly in the smallest compartment in the front. Overall, the bag is stylish (the shoulder straps are integrated with the design very well), well thoughout, and accomplishes its goal.<br /><br />A few flaws, but still worth it.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Great for cold brewed coffee.: I have been making cold brewed coffee lately to cut back on the bitterness from the oils. The Nut Milk Bag helps to remove the last of the grit.<br /><br />I grind coffee beans at between fine to medium and brew the coffee grounds at room temperature for 24 hours in a Bodum French Press. I then strain that liquid through the Nut bag. I heat the coffee to near boiling for a much milder cup of coffee. That way I get the heat and lack of grit I prefer.<br /><br />The bag cleans with just hot running water, without soap which could leave a taste. It's a little more trouble than using a coffee maker, but my taste buds are sensitive enough so that I resent the taste of a paper filter.",5.0,Appliances,1,2
One of My favorite tops! Super comfortable: One of My favorite tops! Super comfortable! It is very sheer of course and the only problem I had was that it's only attached at the waist so I had to sew it closed from the waist till below the pockets for it to be wearable for me!

"Good product, take your time and watch a how-to: I’m gunna give the benefit of the doubt with this and give it a 4/5 review. The mount want SLIGHTLY confusing to install and required some more work than I anticipated. I had trouble getting the plastic nut to fit into the triple tree and ended up having to sand it down for it to pop into the triple tree (one size down was too small). After i finally got the plastic nut to fit I had more trouble getting the rubber expander to fit in all the way and once I finally got it all put together and tighten down the ram mount was a little less than snug and is able to be turned in the triple tree with slight pressure. I wish it fit a little bit better but this also could have been user error on my part. My recommendation is to take your time, watch some videos, and be as precise as possible. The actual phone holder is great as can be expected with ram mounts. Overall I got the product to work well enough that I’m satisfied, but wish the install would have been a little easier.",4.0,Automotive,1,4

"Great Quality - Customize to remove grommets: I agree with other reviewers that these are a very good value.  I had ordered previously from Wayfair and although the price was half what these are, they looked so cheap I had to return.  What I didn't care for about these was the silver grommets.  I think they deserve something better than grommets for hanging which remind me of shower curtains.  I bought a longer length and will cut the end off with the grommets and make a rod pocket.  I'll make the pocket with a flange at the top too so it will have a nice bit of ruffle at the top.  I was happy to see that these curtain panels come with tie backs also - they are a solid cream color that matches the fabric.  I will look into other products this vendor offers.  To buy fabric and make your own panels yourself is much more expensive than just buying panels.",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

I never took before pictures because I never thought it would work this good. Had I known how well this works I would have taken pictures and measurements to prove that this is WELL worth the money! I’ve tried home made and over the counter lash serums before but I will never use anything but this from now on. My eyelashes went from barely discernible to looking like I actually have false lashes! It is pricey and it only lasts about 3-4 months but that is nothing compared to the cost of extensions, false lashes, Etc. Rarely do products live up to their claims but this truly does!! I will add that I also smear Vaseline  on my whole eye area every night After applying the serum and I do believe this aids in the effectiveness. Yes- many people will balk at this but I’m 42 and people think I’m in my early 30s or younger. I’m not above smearing fossil fuels on my face if It will keep me looking young.

"Great for beginner backyard birders: I love this little guide, it's perfect for sitting by bird feeders or the river, and it gives just enough information without being overwhelming, so it's a great jumpstarter for doing further research with a larger book after I've identified the bird. The color sorting is very helpful, and pretty accurate, and I appreciate that there are often separate images for the male and female dimorphic colors. I do wish there were a couple notes about the noises they make, so I can identify when I can't see, and I noticed it was pretty much all perching birds, so it wasn't really a comprehensive guide of Northeast birds.

So Soft!: I ordered this burnt orange comforter to use inside a duvet cover since it has the loops. I wanted something lightweight because I live in Florida and a regular comforter is just too hot.  The one I was using was a nice weight - I got it from ikea.  The problem with it is that it does not have loops to secure the duvet cover so it does not stay in place.  The weight of this one is perfect. It is lightweight but not flat - it does have some fluff to it and will fill out a duvet nicely.  The material is so soft!  I love the color. It is pretty enough to be used without a duvet.  The stitching quality is good.  Really a nice comforter.,5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Fast charge in a slim package: Talk about a compact, heavy duty charging machine! The Eoso 10000mah Ultra Slim portable charger exceeded my expectations right out of the box. It comes with just about everything you need to operate it and mine actually came fully charged which was nice.<br /><br />It has two attached cords, one is a usb which is great if you're charging a laptop. The other is micro usb which works well if you use an android product. Then it has two USB ports meaning you can charge multiple devices assuming you have the cables. Then finally it has a port to charge it which is also usb so you can either charge it with a computer or using a wall charger however that doesn't come with the product. A cool surprise as a small usb lamp that came along with it, I wasn't aware it was included and is a nice little bonus.<br /><br />The casing is sleek and sturdy. It's easy to tell how charged it is with the 4 LED lights, all four lit up means it is fully charged and they go out according to the charge. I'm not sure how long it takes to fully charge but I imagine if you plug it in the night before you use it then you'll be set.<br /><br />This gets 5-stars and I'm not even aware of its durability yet but the quality is so good I can imagine it will last quite some time.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

Clear Sound Quality: We have used the radios five days per week for over a month with no problems.  The sound quality is great and the units are compact.  The price is very reasonable.  Like most people we only need two functions: broadcast and receive.  Unfortunately the scan function is easily accidently triggered and communications are lost until the unit is turned off and on again.  The other negative.  Also the rechargeable battery has a low storage capacity and takes a couple of days to fully charged.<br /><br />I wish Motorola come out with a quality FRS radio without all the extraneous bells and whistles.,5.0,Electronics,1,12

"More Than Just a Great Summer Romance: 4 stars<br /><br />This book really surprised me in a good way. From its cover and description, I wasn't expecting much beyond a typical YA summer romance. While there are elements of that here, this goes deeper and includes some powerful messaging.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Claude, the main character, is in all kinds of turmoil relating to unexpected changes in her life. Claude finds herself on an island with her mom for a solid month of the summer, and that's where she meets this boy - Miah - who is...exactly what you expect: troubled but somehow sensitive and unavailable and also somehow available for Claude?. You know the guy. What's interesting about their relationship is not so much the romance: it's that Claude is still struggling with all of those unknowns AND now this relationship, too. Miah is a periodic distraction from other major issues, but (1) he also makes more drama and (2) those issues don't magically disappear.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this novel is Claude's character. She's perfectly on the cusp of YA and new adult. All of those pivotal moments and questions loom, and her central focus never REALLY wavers: herself. She wants to know herself and experience life, and I love that this commitment does not disappear under the weight of her current challenges. The love story is also sweet without being gross-out nonsense, and the ways in which this novel ends really contribute to how well this plot works. Extra points for well handled demonstrations of consent and condoms. Claude is also believable for her age. She has mature breakthroughs but also a lot of immature responses.  She is - in short - well drawn.<br /><br />I did want to see some added fleshing out of the ancillary characters and - when appropriate - their relationships to each other and especially to/with Claude. Claude collects ghost stories, and at times, I felt that some of the characters dipped into that ghostly territory (like oh yeah. I remember you. What's up with you from 100 pages ago, anyway?). More insight into those characters/relationships could have made Claude even more complex and intriguing.<br /><br />Overall, this one was a pleasant surprise for me.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"3-Pack of 5.5"" Thin-Tip High Precision Stylus Pens: This Friendly Swede 3 pack is pretty good, they work at least as well as the other recommended, more expensive fabric type stylus on my iPad Mini and android phone. The package includes two tethers that can connect your stylus to the headset jack of your iPad or phone so it doesn't get left behind. They also give you 3 extra stylus tips that are easy to replace by simply unscrewing the tip end of the pen, I don't see other brands doing the this. These stylus pens have a more traditional 5.5 inch length like a standard ballpoint pen, and the sturdy aluminum body feels good in the hand as opposed to some other short, plastic competitors. There's also a soft-cloth to clean your screen or the stylus tips. Friendly Swede gives you a good value package for the money, which wouldn't mean much if it did not function, but these pens do work very well, better than most of the others I've tried before.

"Missing key features: I'm picky about planners, and I always buy a Blue Sky planner for every school year and I buy them early because I often need to plan things out months in advance. Unfortunatley, I'm disappointed in the 2022-2023 Features I've always liked are the plastic durable cover, the inside pocket, the coated tabs, and the fact that it is big enough to keep papers stashed in. I like the larger format at a glance monthly calendar as well. Unfortunately, my newest planner (2022-2023) isn't quite as nice. Instead of the front cover being a plastic sleeve with the pretty cover inside, this planner just has a thinner plastic cover and the first page is the decorative page. It is a coated paper, but still not as durable as last year's design. This planner is also missing the plastic folder sleeve, which is very disappointing.",3.0,Office_Products,0,24

"Good Product: I had this in my cart for quite some time so I saw the price fluctuate from $62-$72.  I pulled the trigger and got it installed. I was somewhat surprised at how easy it really was. I got hung up on the water pump pully, until I found the Lisle GM spanner wrench in Advance Auto (AutoZone did not have). Amazon  probably has it also. You tube videos will confuse you most likely. In using a Harmonic puller kit and a 3/8 2in extension, after removing all of the bolts (there are 6 of them)  from the original pully, the old balancer pulled off the engine pretty easily. After lubing up with engine assembly grease the new one then slid on with just the original bolt. No extension kit needed like in the videos. The new balancer if you should need to remove it, works with the Chrysler Harmonic Balancer remover kit from AutoZone. It has everything that you need. It was a decent change out.",4.0,Automotive,1,4

"Cute romance, but needed more plot: Ebook/ARC/paranormal romance:  this is book four in a series that I have not read the rest.  I really don't know how to describe this book because it is not a cozy murder mystery, nor romance.  Danner (horrible character name) is a female whose characteristics I really like.  She is single, wants no strings, lives alone, and desire to be an artist.  Her mother is an acclaimed artist and Danner is spending tons of money on supplies only to find that she's would probably be better painting a room.  I like this because my mother was an acclaimed painter & artist and I am more suited for other art mediums.<br /><br />The first half of the book is slow and I didn't understand Danner's world.  She never talks to ghosts and only mentions seeing her cousin's yard ghosts.  This book is about a gnome she stumbles across in her apartment.  That is where things got cloudy for me because she doesn't want anyone else to see the gnome.  Why?  Get the thing out of the house and into the yard.  I thought there should be a quick one page summary of her abilities.<br /><br />Then there is Toby, her landlord.  He is supposed to be foxy, but all I picture is Toby from &#34;The Office&#34;.  It took a while for me to get that out of my head.  Danner lusts after him, but just wants a roll, which is fine except he's her landlord.  Also, there is something suspect about him because when Danner finally had to fess up to get his help, Toby has no problems with the talking gnome.  I am going out on a limb here, but I think Toby and his handsome looks may be one of the fae.<br /><br />Was it a good book?  It was okay and readable.  I did want to see how it ended with the troll and the book.  I did get this e-book from NetGalley in lieu of an honest review.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"CROSS-CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES ON ADVANCE DIRECTIVES: Hans-Martin Sass, Robert M. Veatch, & Rohito Kimura, editors<br />Advance Directives and Surrogate Decision making in Health Care:<br />United States, Germany, and Japan<br /><br />(Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press: [...], 1998)  311 pages<br />(ISBN: 0-8018-5831-3; hardcover)<br />(Library of Congress call number: R726.2.A38 1998)<br />(Medical call number: W85.5A245 1998)<br /><br />  This book examines many aspects of advance decision-making<br />for people who might later become incapable of making medical decisions.<br />It takes a cross-cultural look at actual practices<br />as well as the laws in the USA, Germany, & Japan.<br />Each contributor writes about the situation in his own country.<br /><br />  The most important chapter is by Alan Meisel, JD:<br />Chapter 2: ""Legal Issues in Decision Making for Incompetent Patients:<br />Advance Directives and Surrogate Decision Making"".<br />When state laws have attempted to limit the scope of Advance Directives,<br />the courts have usually allowed the written AD to prevail.<br />Legal incompetence (losing all adult rights) is usually not required<br />for an Advance Directive to be effective.<br />Normally the doctor merely turns to the next of kin<br />when the patient seems no longer able to make wise medical decisions.<br />Some states have attempted to set a higher standard of proof<br />for the decision to withhold or withdraw food and water,<br />but courts have usually ruled that these are forms of medical treatment,<br />which can therefore be decided in the same ways as any other treatments.<br />We always have the right to refuse medical treatment.<br />And we always have the right to give up food and water.<br />The fact that nutrition and hydration are provided by tubes makes no difference.<br /><br />  Meisel notes that 'check-list' Advance Directives<br />do not easily take into account specific situations where decisions must be made.<br />For example, many people check the box stating<br />that they never want to be put on a ventilator.<br />But all reasonable people would accept temporary breathing assistance<br />is it will restore them to their normal, healthy lives.<br />'Check-list' ADs might seem attractive to doctors and patients<br />because they look like standard medical forms.<br />But more personal statements and discussions<br />are more helpful for actual medical decision-making.<br />Most ADs are expressed in brief and general language,<br />which does not easily translate into medical decisions at the bedside.<br />Therefore, it is very important to appoint appropriate proxies.<br />When there are no surrogates named,<br />the law says that doctor should ask the 'next of kin'.<br />But the law cannot tell the difference between<br />kin who are close and kin who are estranged.<br />Therefore, we should name the person or persons<br />we find most appropriate to make our medical decisions<br />when we can no longer make wise choices.<br />Because proxies are usually involved in our lives,<br />they almost always have something to lose or gain by our deaths.<br />Such conflicts of interest cannot be entirely avoided.<br />But we can be aware of them and seek to minimize their effect.<br /><br />  The status of Advance Directives in Germany<br />is a few decades behind their status in the United States.<br />Few doctors have been asked to deal with them.<br />They are not yet legal documents.<br />And most of the suggested forms are about refusing treatment.<br /><br />  The situation in Japan is similar:<br />Paternalism from the medical profession prevails.<br />And sometimes the patient is not even told that he or she is dying.<br />This is intended to spare the patient the additional suffering of facing death.<br />It is just too distressing to the patient and family to talk about dying.<br />When no one is willing to acknowledge the dying process,<br />Advance Directives for Medical Care are irrelevant.<br />Everything is going to be decided by the doctor in any case.<br />Also, writing down one's wishes<br />might be taken as a sign of distrust of one's relatives.<br />It is more polite to communicate verbally and interpersonally.<br />The only medical discussions are about treatments,<br />seldom about preparing for death.<br />In Japan ADs are only for people already dying:<br />""If you get a terminal disease, do you want to write an advance directive?""<br />And, as in Germany, ADs do not yet have the force of law.<br />And even fewer Japanese create ADs than Americans.<br /><br />  Because of the Japanese denial of death,<br />there is also very little organ transplantation<br />because there is no way to decide in advance to donate.<br />Brain-death has only recently been accepted as a definition of death.<br /><br />  This book concludes with about 50 pages<br />devoted to several kinds of Advance Directives,<br />from the USA, Germany, & Japan.<br />These range from short generic statements,<br />to check-lists of treatments and values,<br />to narrative forms that ask what we would want<br />if we were in the given circumstances.<br /><br />  This book is probably the first to discuss<br />Advance Directives across different cultures.<br />The English-speaking world has led the way.<br />And we can see how far we have already come in the USA<br />when we look at the situations in other countries.<br /><br />If you would like to see my reviews of several other books on Advance Directives,<br />search the Internet for the following phrase:<br

An exploration of how men became monks or didn't: I am reading them in order so this is my 9th book since  I started with the prequel a Rare Benedictine. each of the books' mysteries involve some aspect of medieval life that is described in detail. This one deals with how men became monks in medieval times .  The mystery is why Meriet at his young age (actually old for a novice they can start as infants!) wants to become a monk. The larger mystery really unfolds later in the book. This one seems slower than the preceding ones - a lot more detail and description. The final solution is a bit rushed as a result- but a good additional to the Cadfael Chronicles- now to watch the TV adaptation.,5.0,Books,1,7

"Tastes like caramelized sweet potatoes: Had to look up what yacon was - apparently they're a perennial daisy that grows edible tuberous roots found in the Andean region of South America, and they seem to have some nice nutritional benefits. This particular product seems to be advertised as a natural sweetener substitute for sugar (not maple syrup or molasses like some others have mentioned). It also recommends only using up to 3 teaspoons daily - which seems to be very limiting if you wanted to use this in more than just coffee or tea. I found the flavor similar to that of caramelized sweet potatoes. Though there was a mild sweet flavor, I didn't really find this syrup that sweet. Tried this in both tea and coffee and though it did add a bit of sweetness it wasn't equal to that of regular sugar.  The taste isn't bad and given the health benefits associated with this I think it's worth continuing to try this, but if you're looking for the same level of sweetness as sugar then this may not be the right option for you, but that's just per my tasting.",4.0,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,1,14

"Employees beware: [[ASIN:1250009499 Dead Peasants: A Thriller]]At the recent Thrillerfest in New York I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Thompson and getting this book. I was intrigued from reading the book cover by the story of how big corporations take advantage of their employees, especially the mention of insurance policies taking out at no cost to the employees. This got me reading because I remembered signing one of these forms when I was first hired at my company but forgot about it until this book.  Big companies take little regard of employees especially in today's economy,we are just numbers and unnecessary labor cost. Just like the book The Rainmaker by John Grishom with story of how health care insurance tries to not pay for claims, this story tells a tale of how companies who brought ""life insurance"" on their employees profit from them as they die collecting on these policies unknown to the families. They employe a computer program that moniters the Social Security service and death notices and collect on these insurances to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.  Meanwhile these employees are low waged never making more than average wages compared to the CEO's who make monthly more than the employees make in a year.  These same companies also claim they are going bankrupt with all their rising costs and are eliminating jobs so they can pay less labor. Besides this main story, you have the story of a non-corrupt lawyer (there are a few around)who had retired back to his home town in Texas after winning a big settlement to start a pro-bono clinic to help those who couldn't afford a lawyers for various things. It was one of these clients who unmasked the whole dead peasants policies when they received the large payout by accident from the USPO (who says they don't deliver). This was a quick read as I kept reading as the story unfolded plus I did followup online and found these policies are still around but well hidden in legal paperwork by big companies.",5.0,Books,1,7

"good book  fond memories: fine reading about an amazing group of players on both teams. I was 18 and actually went to game four in Baltimore, October 9 1966. one of my fondest baseball memories and I have many. born in Baltimore, I went to my first game in 1954 and I remember all of the facts that this book presents. almost 100% accurate. the authors problem is that he refers to Baltimore as the capitol of Maryland several times. Maybe it should be, but Annapolis is the capitol of Maryland. A true Oriole fan would have known that from childhood.

Nearly impossible to prevent I've tweaked the setup every possible way and it just won't stay in place. I have to carry tools ALWAYS when off-road to repair it.

"Noteworthy Resource: It's interesting that books on fieldwork tend to exclude extended discussions of note-taking as a part of fieldwork.  The focus of many guides on fieldwork methods usually is on completing audio or video interviews and on the use of photography in fieldwork.  This book fills this gap in research methodology.  The writers show good, practical techniques for taking notes during ethnographic and oral history field research.  More importantly, they convincingly demonstrate how creating good fieldnotes is essential to completing good ethnographic studies.  Each section of the book blends practical ideas with theoretical generalizations in ways that not only show readers how to complete field research, but the discussion also reveals why these techniques are useful.  The chapter that provides ways to turn fieldnotes into written ethnographies is an especially helpful discussion of a challenging task.  In this particular chapter, and in the book in general, readers can find ideas that can also be applied to the use of other field-generated resources such as structured audio/video interviews and photo sessions.  This book is also valuable as a resource for understanding and examining various written ethnographic studies.  In this respect, the insights offered by Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw give readers good ideas for evaluating written ethnographies and useful perspectives for understanding the process of completing ethnographically-grounded research and how ethnographic study contributes to the representation of culture.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Excellent gift for young children and their parents!: I don't know exactly what the magic is that makes a certain small number of board books wonderful to read over and over again, but whatever it is, this book has it.<br /><br />Maybe it's the beautiful text, that is a joy to read, with every word carefully considered, like a poem. Some writers seem to treat the words chosen for the very littlest kids cavalierly, but the writer of this book understands that it can be simple AND beautiful.<br /><br />Maybe it's the gorgeous drawings that you want to look at again and again.<br /><br />Maybe it's the sweet moments it is depicting, moments that make you feel happy.<br /><br />But I think the most important thing is that this book operates on multiple levels. It is a sweet book about a father (love that she made it the father) who gets up ""too early"" to care for a little one who has woken up. Which parent among us has not had that experience? It is wonderful when you happen to catch a beautiful sunrise as a silver lining for getting up with your little one, and I love that this book captures that moment.<br /><br />But on a deeper level, the fact that the book is voiced by the child, and the child refuses to be scolded, instead believing that ""too early"" is ""just in time"" in their world, shows an incredibly resilient spirit and something that should indeed be celebrated, as it is so beautifully and subtly is in this book. The subtlety is appreciated.<br /><br />At another moment in the book the child's voice says, ""Don't you tell me I got up too early doggies, I know that you sleep all day"" (paraphrased). Hilarious, and so true first of all, but another example of a child refusing to be defined by those around them. You go little one, don't ever lose that spirit!<br /><br />What a great book. This is going on that one shelf with the books you reach for first.",5.0,Books,1,7

My request was to return the base only for replacement and Amazon contacted Aromis on my behalf.

We are a house divided however as half of my family belongs to the miracle whip team and then the people who are right belong to team mayo. LOL This is a really good light mayo. It is rich, creamy and smooth. Has nice acidity with a good balance between egg and vinegar and lemon juice. This light version runs 35 calories per tablespoon and 3.5 g of fat. Which is less then the average 45 cals per tbls and 4.5 g fat. We use it in tuna or egg salad and on sandwhiches too. Choosing the light version is a very easy way to save calories and fat.

"Much better than most smaller toaster ovens.: I have been using a Hamilton Beach toast station for about a year; it toasts great, but has limited room for taller rolls and bread.  Since I am using more rolls than toast lately, I decided that a small toaster oven would work better for me at the moment.<br /><br />I wanted electronic controls, since many of the mechanical controls seem to get stuck in the ""on"" position, and cause the occasional fire (!)  I also needed a smaller toaster oven; I do not cook whole pizzas or family sized portions in the thing, and I have very limited counter space, so there was no need for a giant machine.  This narrowed down my choices considerably.<br /><br />I first tried a Kenmore (looks like it was made by Black and Decker), but you could not adjust the temperature once you set it without totally exiting out of the mode it was in and shutting it off!  That was very annoying, so I returned it.  This Delonghi seemed to be both the right size and had the right controls, so I figured I would try it.<br /><br />I am very happy with it.  It warms bread and rolls nicely; I get good results with my toast; and the controls are easy to set and adjust without having to shut the whole thing down if you make a mistake.  Also on the plus side, the plastic odor that is common in these things when they are new was very minimal in this one, and went away very quickly.<br /><br />The beep IS loud, but after a couple of weeks I stopped noticing it, so it's not a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />This impresses me as a better made product than most of the smaller ovens out there, and hopefully it will live up to my expectations for its longevity.  All-in-all, I think it is a very good choice for a small toaster oven, and I would definitely recommend it over the competition.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

Good for the money.: The sound of this exhaust is amazing. And loud. However the install was a little bit hard for me but I got it done in about 2 hours with some help. Maybe I got unlucky but the headers were a really tight fit and took some work and light taps to get it in. The strap that goes around the muffler is very hard to install because it doesn't like to wrap all the way around the muffler but with some help and needle nose vice grips I was able to get the strap on properly. I noticed some people made a bracket or cut the other side of the strap off to make it work and you do not need to do that.

"Sad, but compelling story of LBJ: I purchased this book from a used book store after seeing the PBS documentary on the US Presidents, one of which featured LBJ. The documentary contained lots of information found in this book. I believe the book does not go into the detail that the Caro or Dalek book would, but it is, nevertheless, a very good read.<br /><br />The book covers Lyndon's early political life in Texas and the influence that his father and mother had upon his career. Kearns writes of his ascent through the Legislature during the Hoover years to his presidency during the 60s.<br /><br />And the story of his battle with wanting to do ""right"" with Vietnam, his inability to understand the Vietnamese culture, and his struggles with the Civil Rights movement are fascinating.<br /><br />If there is any complaint that I have is that Kearns did not dwell too much on his life as Vice President. And that period, I think, is very interesting in how he developed his hatred for Robert and the way he was treated by the ""Harvards"". The documentary on PBS covered this much more than her book.<br /><br />However, I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in LBJ.",3.0,Books,0,7

"What's the point?: This game seems more like a work in progress than a finished product. There are no instructions given. There's a &quot;Level up x1&quot; button that doesn't seem to do anything. There's another button that toggles the &quot;Encouragement Mode&quot; in and off, but it also appears to do nothing.<br /><br />I opened the game for the first time and was at a loss. Like I said, there is no guidance in the game at all. I clicked around and eventually managed to acquire a couple of heroes. As soon as you get heroes, apparently they start collecting gold. Under the &rdquo;Quests&quot; heading, I figured out that I needed to level up my heroes to level 25 in order to send them on quests. So to level them up, all that is required is to accumulate the amount of gold needed and click on the hero.  That seems kind of pointless, really.  The only requirement to level up is sit and wait.<br /><br />After levelling a couple of heroes up, I sent them on quests. These are not little mini games you get to play or even little cut scenes to watch. The quests are just little signs that now cover the hero's picture that says he's on a quest. Little words appear that say he needs encouragement, but I haven't found any way to do that. So like the levelling up, the quests are just sitting and waiting. When a quest is over, there doesn't seem to be anything to do except wait to collect enough gold to send a hero in the next quest.<br /><br />I gave this two stars simply because the illustrations are cute and the character descriptions are a little amusing. But beyond that, there doesn't seem to be much &quot;game&quot; about it. It's just waiting until you've accumulated enough gold to click the next button. If there is more to the game than that, maybe some instructions would be a good idea.",2.0,Software,0,27

In Bringing Home More Than Groceries, Kristin shares her stories--and her friends' stories--of hospitality and the way it can enrich our lives and even grow our faith when we remember why it is we gather in the first place. These stories make me even more determined to step away from Pinterest and step into true hospitality with my people.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"This has totally replaced microwave popcorn for me— YUM!: My friend told me about her glass microwave popcorn popper and I knew I needed one. But I didn’t live the idea of a glass jar version (she said her daughter shattered hers once) PLUS space is an issue for me.<br /><br />So on to Amazon I went, hunting for an alternative and I found this. I love that it collapses down to an inch or two high. I generally use 1/4 to 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels.<br /><br />I’ve been using this frequently for 8 months now and will say you do need to use care when taking this out of the microwave— the silicone is initially really hot (but cools down pretty quickly). Also, the lid has turned kind of yellow-ish. Not sure why, as I’ve never used any oils, butter, etc. inside the container while popping but I’d still buy this one again.<br /><br />Also, do yourself a favor and buy the huge container of Flavacol Amazon sells— my friend turned me into it and it’s the stuff the movie theatres use to make their popcorn delicious (hence the ginormous container you have to buy it in).",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"A decent film, but not an earthshaker.: It's a good set up film for the following sequel. This is not a stand alone movie as it throws you into the story immediately and if you haven't seen the previous film then you will be lost. That seems obvious but it is important to remember when considering the quality of this one. It's not a fantastic film, but it is part of the story and therefore necessary. It primarily consists of set up and really lacks a solid story arc as it is an installment of the series. Because of this I give it three stars. It really could have been developed better but unfortunately the narrative lacks reward for the viewer beyond continuing the plot. That is not to say that it is an entirely bad movie but if you aren't into the series then you will find little entertainment value.",3.0,Movies_and_TV,0,22

"The photos are fantastic, but beware some of the procedures.: I purchased his book, for several reasons.  I have suffered from lower lumbar back pain for 40 years.  Forty years ago, the Veterans Administration Hospital strongly recommended surgery. And meanwhile provided grocery bags of pain killers.<br /><br />But I also lived and worked in an African village for two years. I knew Esther was on the right track. The functional posture and strength of both men and woman in the tribe in which I lived, was  awesome. Esther's photographs beautifully capture the functional strength and poise that I witnessed many years ago.<br /><br />I bought this book with great hopes. Sadly, some of the ideas in this book only injured my back further.<br /><br />But I can also say the same for the dozens of &#34;back books&#34; and seminars which I have read or attended over forty years. Whether the subject is Tai Chi, Yoga, or Pilates, I always find that some exercises seem to help, but there are unhappily always a few exercises that do further injury. And there is the rub.<br /><br />I am also amazed that Esther does not show the ancient &#34;village squat.&#34; This is a glaring omission. A westerner can not live, or travel, in the 3rd world and not observe the ease and frequency with which villagers - young and old - can assume the village squat.<br />Generally, Westerners just can't seem to squat like this for any length of time.  I am mystified that this functional and popular position is not captured in her photographs.<br /><br />I would love to see Esther take her beautiful - but beginning research - a step further.<br /><br />Thankfully, I eventually found right here - at Amazon - some back books and DVD's which have given me relief from back pain for the first time in 40 years  - as well as a new found ability to run and ice skate again.<br /><br />Admittedly, my search was a long journey, but I found the best self help yet in the books and DVD's of Peter Egoscue.  Book by book, I became so impressed with the results, that I eventually bought every book and DVD Peter has written or produced.<br /><br />My back problems are largely confined to the lower lumbar area, due to injuries sustained in Vietnam in 1970.<br /><br />Ironically, Peter Egoscue is also a Vietnam veteran who sustained injuries while on duty. Peter embarked on his own search to heal himself.<br /><br />What a marvelous, simple and sound approach he has pioneered.  Not one of Peter egoscue's procedures has ever caused my back further injury or pain!<br /><br />In response to the one negative comment I received, may I affirm and clarify that my back injuries are serious - due to substantial injuries sustained in Vietnam. I do recognize that many other people will be well served by Esther's exercises.<br /><br />But, I also wish to extend a hopeful hand to those whose injuries are severe, life long, and who so far may have found only partial or intermittent help with the many modalities of back treatment that have developed over the past 40 years.<br /><br />In addition, to the books and DVD's I recommended above, I now wish to one more book that I earlier withheld - due to its price. &#34;Rehabilitation of The Spine: A Practitioner's Manual&#34; by Craig Liebsenson. Available here on Amazon.<br /><br />Yes, the price is edgy! But this book is a must have for anyone who experiences chronic and severe back difficulties. A magnificent and clearly articulated review of all of the current treatment modalities available in the mainstream as well as the alternative medical fields today. Pay attention to what Dr Vladimir Janda is doing to treat patients in Czechoslovakia.<br /><br />Ok. A couple years later, and I wish to add another writer, especially for those persons with serious injuries - sports related or work related. I discovered the fellow who has co-authored more than 300 clinical published studies on the back and spine.  He is a fountainhead of knowledge for trainers and rehab experts alike. He is quoted by the best of the best trainers regularly. Two of his books -  directed toward the medical professional ---  are available here on Amazon. &#34;Low Back Disorders&#34; and &#34;Ultimate Back Fitness & Performance&#34;  by Stuart McGill, PhD.<br /><br />His research methods are exquisite.  He busts more fitness myths than any writer I have yet read - and he does this with science based data, much of it derived from his own labs. I must caution that he writes to the trainer and rehab audience. But his writing is extremely clear to me, a lay person. Nearly every page in the first half of book, &#34;Low Back Disorders,&#34; is filled with lab evidence as to why so much of what your coach, your drill instructor, your fitness guru, and / or the muscles mags are saying is simply dangerous or wrong.  This half steers you away from incredibly dangerous , but popular routines. That knowledge alone is worth a lot.<br /><br />As you will recognize in all of his books and DVD's, Dr Stuart McGill works with the highest performing world class athletes.<br /><br />He also publishes two DVD's which I have not found here on Amazon.<br /><br />Once again, good luck with your own search for back health.<br /><br />Added, Sep 11, 2016<br />Are you folks  aware that Dr Stuart McGill has finally released a new book.  His first book in his 30+ year career, now intended to help the lay person? Everyday folks.<br /><br />Having read all of Dr McGill's books and watched all of his DVD's -- which are geared toward the professional, I can now say that this new book, &#34;Back Mechanic&#34; is the best written and edited, the best produced and best illustrated of all his books.<br /><br />I presented a copy of this book to an attending Physician at  the local Veteran's Medical Center, Department of Rehabilitative medicine.<br />I told her I might recommend this book to other veterans. But first would like to hear her own opinion. Do you think these ideas will case any harm?<br />Do you think these ideas will help veterans?<br /><br />She got back to me, &#34;I love it! It is so easy to read. So easy for the veteran to understand.  I have received approval from the Department Director to make this book available to all of my veteran patients. We are now seeking the funding from the Education Department.<br /><br />It was released just recently.<br />Available at Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Back-Mechanic-Dr-Stuart-McGill/dp/0973501820<br /><br />Most importantly, for the first time Dr McGill has included a self diagnosis procedure, so that every day persons can hopefully determine the major causes and/or sources of their back pain.<br />The book covers rehabilitation remedies that address each particular diagnosis.<br /><br />I can say that having read all of his prior books and learned so much, I am now learning even more in this beautiful edition. The illustrations are clear and extensive.<br /><br />Once again, Stuart McGill dispels so many sports rehabilitation myths and legends. He lays bare many surprising details that are truly harmful to a healthy back. And describes in detail the way back to real recovery.<br /><br />I am only a bit more than 1/2 way through it.<br />I deliberately set a slow pace. Stopping to try out his techniques and his self diagnosis strategies.<br /><br />We are fortunate to have the wisdom of this man who has spent decades in his research laboratory as well as his rehabilitation facility. He has worked with the world's top elite athletes for all of these decades, as well as everyday folks who are injured.<br /><br />This book may become the classic in its field. The starting place.<br /><br />I will may write a review and post it when I have finished reading the entire book.<br /><br />Good luck.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Crowd-pleasing and outrageous! A box-office smash!: This spoof on horror classics and TV shows will be a success as the original!

Of course Marlon &amp; Shawn Wayans, Regina Hall, and Anna Faris from the original appear! The plot varies from classic horror films such as &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, &quot;Carrie&quot;, and &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; and the comedy action film, &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot;! The motion picture takes place in a haunted mansion where the ghouls trip down stairs, ghosts whispering, clowns under beds, cat fights, exorcisms and of course the body count piles up in a funny way! The previews give you a big hint on what the plot is and what some of the parodies happen to be! It'll be a huge hit! Opens JULY 4th nationwide in theaters!",3.0,Unknown,0,32

Those who want a bit more support can just add a sports bra, though I have to admit that for the price prAna is charging, they really should get more into engineering a Kaley Tunic with more support.

"This series just keeps getting better and better!!: (Reviewer's Note: I would like to thank Ms. Bennett for providing a print review copy in exchange for an hosest review.)<br /><br />This second novel in the series is even more riveting and compelling than the first novel, and the novella which follows it. In fact, I would say that Bennett has surpassed herself in this installment!<br /><br />The saga of Maya the hybrid 'angel' (actually an energy vampire) and her vigilante half-brothers is seriously addictive reading! In ""Landing"", the relationship of the three siblings becomes even more poignant, as the reader learns further details about their family history, and they are thrown into even more danger.<br /><br />Maya is a totally admirable character; she's constantly fighting against the hunger -- that insatiable desire to 'feed' on energy from humans, killing them in the process. She manages to get by through draining small animals, but the hunger for human energy is always present, tormenting her. In spite of her situation, she's courageous, funny, snarky, and strongly loyal to her brothers, insisting on joining them on all their missions. She's definitely a great heroine!<br /><br />I didn't think it was possible to love Gabe even more than I already did, but, in this novel, his kindness and endless sweetness toward Maya just made me want to hug him! His implicit trust in her is very touching, especially since he knows she could destroy him if she ever lost control. His easygoing, laid-back attitude, in the face of their family tragedy, is absolutely wonderful! Unlike Tarren, Gabe wears his heart on his sleeve. Maya, who can see human auras, can read him much more easily than she can Tarren, who keeps a very tight rein on his emotions.<br /><br />As for Tarren, I have very mixed feelings about him.  It seemed that he was beginning to trust Maya more in Coping, the novella in this series. However, this is really not the case at all; his attitude toward her remains one of cautious tolerance. He never fully lets her in, so she can only catch glimpses of what he must be feeling. He's even willing to risk her life at one point in the plot, against Gabe's vehement protests. So I found myself alternately disliking him, and then feeling sorry for him. After all, he has suffered at the hands of the heinous villain in these books -- terribly so. Still, his actions toward Maya are really unforgivable. In this novel, the reader finds out just how deeply he has betrayed her, simply because he's in pursuit of revenge.<br /><br />Two new characters are introduced in this installment -- a married couple, Kyle and Jane. They're both 'angels'. Maya meets them one night, after she and her brothers have returned from an unsuccessful mission.<br /><br />These characters are very likable, paradoxically enough. They want to take Maya under their wing, and she almost gives in, just so she can feel totally accepted and loved. However, she realizes that Kyle is trying to rationalize the 'angel' lifestyle by telling her that she should only drain people who really 'deserve' it, like criminals, or people who are already dying. She knows that killing a human being is wrong, no matter how you try to justify it. Her condition as a hybrid -- not completely human, yet, not fully an 'angel' -- helps her to resist  the lure of this evil.<br /><br />The action really ratchets up in this novel, as the siblings finally confront the villain -- Grand. In the process, the reader encounters his very sick, disgusting, views toward the humans who have not been 'enhanced'. This is a villain you love to hate; the  thoughts of this most nefarious 'angel' mirror those of Hitler and his Nazis in their contempt for 'inferior people'. Indeed, this warped philosophy is also behind the eugenics movement. Bennett is thus implicitly criticizing it, and I admire her for doing so.<br /><br />This novel, like the previous books in this series, has very profound philosophical implications underlying its action-filled plot. It's also a great example of masterful, suspenseful writing. Furthermore, it's peopled by very vivid, fully fleshed-out characters whose struggles and emotions we the readers come to feel and understand as if we were also going through the same things.<br /><br />Powerfully intense, stunningly compelling, this is a novel that will not let readers go until the very last page is turned! Bennett fully immerses the reader in her terrifying, totally believable world, and she does so with remarkable ease.<br /><br />These characters will remain completely unforgettable to me, even after I've finished reading the last novel in the series, ""Rising"", which I am planning to purchase just as soon as I possibly can! In all honesty, I simply can't praise these books enough, in spite of their very dark themes, and the bleakness of this future, dystopian world. Still, hope remains ever present, and evil will not get the upper hand. In the final analysis, this is what's truly important. Kudos to J. Bennett for her imaginative portrayal of the darkness, as well as the light, within the human soul!",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Useful, but shallow: This book offers some useful ethnographic information on how animal cruelty is understood and talked about by humane agents, teen-agers, hoarders, shelter workers, marketers and media, and how people in these positions are seen by others.  Unfortunately, it is also tedious, repetitious, and uninspired in its cultural analysis of animal cruelty as a window into how we see the relationship between humans and their fellow creatures.<br />The author's mechanical use of the distinction between a ""normative"" and a ""descriptive"" approach (i.e. that he is not making judgments, but rather simply giving an objective account) ill fits his subject; his approach to it is also rather naïve at this point in the history of the social sciences.  The main upshot is a rather flattened account of what Arluke himself recognizes as a morally, legally, culturally, emotionally complex and compelling subject.<br />Arluke draws on the work of some truly original and interesting thinkers - notably, Clifford Geertz and Claude Levi-Strauss - unfortunately, to very little effect. His use of Levi-Strauss's analysis of why animals are ""good to think"" is especially unfortunate; in calling animal cruelty ""good to think"", Arluke simply sows confusion in the mind of anyone who has felt truly enlightened by Levi-Strauss's brilliant analysis of totemism .<br />My own favorite sentence in the book comes in the last paragraph, as the author is wrestling with the constraints imposed by his own concept of what is proper behavior for a sociologist: ""I certainly struggled for the right words to describe the mistreatment of animals, but no matter how I expressed my thinking, it always fell short of what I suspected was the reality.""  One virtue this book definitely does have is honesty.",2.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"Thick/good quality/oversized: I purchased the “A Stripe Khaki” color in size small. I’ll start by saying I really like how the quality of this sweater felt. It’s thick, oversized, and does not feel cheap. I only ended up returning because I just don’t think I like stripes on me. But it’s not the sweater issue. Just a me issue. I like stripes on others, but, for some reason, stripes just always make me feel wide. Because the pattern I chose had stripes and the cut is already oversized, I didn’t feel like it was flattering on me. But I’d probably like to re-order this in just a solid color due to the quality and feel of it. For reference, I’m about 5’2” tall, 103 lbs., 30DD/32D chest.

"but books like Lucifer's Hammer: It's been several years since I read Lucifer's Hammer, and it's a book I think about regularly. It's a classic novel, and even though it was written a fair time ago, it still stands the test of time. I'm a child of the 80's, and this book just speaks to me. That period of time had so much going for it. It had an intangible spark to it, where you really did think anything was possible. We were building the space shuttle. From there, we were going to the stars. Well...that didn't happen, but books like Lucifer's Hammer, and many of the Niven and Pournelle novels captured that quality, that hopefulness, in a bottle. Yeah, I know, this is a book about the Apocalypse, in essence, yet it fills me with hope and nostalgia for a time much better than one we currently live in.<br /><br />If you're a fan of scifi, this is a great book.

"Literally, Black Girl Magic: While Touched By Shadows is a supernatural/cosmic horror fiction, it strongly showcases the true horrors of Racism. I am an avid horror reader and the scarier the book is, the harder it is for me to put it away; I love to be frightened. However, the real horrors that POC, like the characters Oumou, Leslie, and Carver, faced had me take a few breaks between reading. Vaughn A. Jackson has a talent for spotlighting these horrific truths in a way that is not meant to glorify the violence for the sake of horror but to shine a light on the heroes who fight the racial atrocities that still exist. Is the King of Thornes a metaphor for the deeply rooted evil that embedded itself around our world for centuries to the present? I seem to think so. Is Oumou the light and the heart of every innocent rising against these atrocities? I hope so because she is an absolute badass and puts a stamp on the phrase “Black Girl Magic”.<br />Jackson’s use of imagery has the ability to scare me after the lights go out. The descriptions normally touch on all of the five senses leaving me with an uneasy feeling way after I’m done reading—which is why I purposely look for this emerging Speculative fiction author. His first book, “Up From the Deep” left me with the same unnerving impression after learning of his most villainous character(s). To reiterate, he also has a way of shoving a mirror into the face of racism in his works. Touched By Shadows so far has held no punches in that regard. If you liked Stranger Things, do yourself a favor and read this book, it is far more relatable than the show. Not knocking the show but Ummm, there was only one POC in it and he wasn’t a main character. I couldn’t relate.<br /> I look forward to reading and reviewing more of this Author’s works. #BlackAuthors #BlackLiterature #RepresentationMatters",5.0,Books,1,7

"FLOTSAM is a fantastic and frenetically paced foray of finny fiction!: OK, so forced alliteration aside, FLOTSAM is quite simply an excellent and page-turning read.  The author’s background and real-life experiences, from deep sea dives to adventures in the South Pacific, allow him to write from a position of quiet knowledge, sharp humor, and believability in the surroundings and events.  I found myself being challenged to do occasional side-bar Googles to learn more on many fronts during my read, be it about the Rock Islands, Koror, Palau, or Papau…not to mention learning so many important details about deep sea diving (it’s convinced me to NOT have diving on my own bucket list!).<br /><br />Overall, Tracy delivers the delicate ability to paint the scene, character, and event for my own visualization, but not at the expense of ponderously long and arduous reading – the story kicks off almost immediately and keeps the pace and suspense (and believability) clipping along….even with a soaking wet MJ (go read for yourself).  I couldn’t help but think that this book could easily be a big budget movie, with minimal script changes.  Panoramic scenery, interesting characters with their own strengths and flaws, great dialogue, and a great suspenseful story.<br /><br />The only unanswerable piece for me is, what exactly does the title FLOTSAM represent?  Island and sea pollution?  The broken and discarded pieces of several people’s lives including even Ricky perhaps?  Meh. Doesn’t really matter.  All in all, I’m in for DERELICT, the second in the Ricky series.  Way to set the bar high for yourself, Tracy, right out of the gate!",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Fantastic Budget Nozzles for Your Average Hobbyist: These nozzles are great for a hobbyist. They work well with PLA, ABS, and any other standard polymers one may be printing. I tried these in an Ender 3 and every size worked well, and fit without issue. They also have a somewhat different shape than many other nozzles, which helps to keep them separated.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-About 37 cents apiece. No worries if you need to scrap one and replace it.<br />-A vast variety of sizes, so you can try multiple nozzles to see which parameters work best.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Only two of each nozzle. If you happen to lose one, you need to treasure your remaining one.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great purchase for anyone who is hoping to try a variety of nozzle sizes before they buy a bunch of a particular size.

"Sweet but fell flat for me: I received an Advanced Reader Copy of this book from the publisher and am voluntarily reviewing it.<br /><br />I loved reading the pervious book in this series even though they were not my usual fair for romance books.

"The NEW LABEL on the bottle is a mistake.  Bring back the TRADITIONAL LABEL.: My review is for the NEW LABEL.  The soap inside the bottle is, of course, as wonderful as ever.  I hate the new label.  All the interesting, fun, inspirational, and sometimes wacky sayings and statements from the original Dr. Bronner label are gone.  They are replaced with a label filled with nothing but statements about &#34;fair wages for all workers&#34;.  Don't get me wrong, I support fair wages, but I do not want to see it on the label of my soap, especially when it is replacing the beloved traditional label.  Plus, this seems like the wrong group to preach this message to, since I am guessing most people buying Dr. B's soap already support fair wages, so you are preaching to the choir.<br /><br />This was a very poor marketing choice.

I went out and bought this CD right away and have been enjoying it ever since.  I've only heard a few of her earlier recordings, but I always prefer the renditions presented here.  It was also a surprise to hear her being saontaneous throught the concert after all the talk I heard of her being such a perfectionist.  The best such instance of this is when she slips into her 'verklempt' speach right before 'You Don't Bring Me Flowers'.

Soloist is somewhat forward. Instrumental separation perhaps not as detailed as in &#34;modern&#34; recordings.  Bass line of lower strings perhaps not as resin-y as one might wish;  it's there in the performance, but the style of recording doesn't really quite capture the &#34;punch&#34;.<br /><br />But, as noted above, this is a *very* enjoyable recording.",4.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

As far as faster healing,  I don't know about that claim,  it seems to keep the wound moist so it doesn't scab up and to me it seems like it still takes long.

I weigh 220 lbs, I'm 6 ft, but around a 38&#34; on the waist. If you fit my description, get the US XL (Asian XXL). It's meant as a stylish modern dress vest to compliment any t-shirt you're wearing (I like to wear band shirts, so I'm going to wear this with band shirts).<br /><br />At first I wasn't really impressed and kind of disappointed, but after putting it on and buttoning it up (there are buttons on the inside and out to act as a fastener) I stood in front of my mirror and basically said, &#34;Yeah. It's not bad.&#34;<br /><br />Probably a major con would it is that the thin material is see-through, and the overlapping of the waist fastener increases the amount of visible white, which, in my opinion, looks kind of silly.

"BEAUTIFUL PLAYING WITH A RATHER FLAT SOUND: As the heading states, the playing of this concerto is excellent, though not as exciting as the Leon Fleisher recording.  My problem is with the sound, which is rather flat.  Even the excellent Rubinstein recording of 1954 has better sound than this.  In a desperate search for the desert island recording of this concerto, I have also ordered the Gilels, but I will have to edit my comment after it arrives.  My all-time favorite recording of this concerto so far is the Graffman/Munch/Boston Symphony recording.  I even heard Graffman play it at my university and my piano prof went out to dinner with him.  Alas!  That recording is not available on CD.  If you have the equipment to play that LP and transfer it to CD, it would be worth the effort.  Addendum 2/3/17.  I have just compared the Ashkenazy, Fleisher, Rubinstein, and the Gilels back to back.  The Gilels was the worst.  The tempo can be compared to that of a snail.  By far the slowest rendering I have ever heard.  The Rubinstein was also too slow and dragged at times.  Also, Rubinstein and the conductor seemed at odds on the tempo.  The conductor began with the fastest tempo I had ever heard and then Rubinstein slows it down to a point that is too slow and boring.  Then the conductor would try to speed it up and Rubinstein would slow it down.  If the two had agreed on a temp that was halfway between the two, it would have been a great recording, but it is not.",4.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Impressed so far: Overall I am impressed with this skillet.  Some pros:  compact design is very nice - the base folds and fits inside the skillet for storage - nice thinking by designers ; the pour spout is fantastic for draining ground beef or water - why no one thought of this before is beyond me - excellent thinking ; the heating seemed evenly distributed - boiling seemed to occur throughout the middle and the sides - many skillets tend to just get to boiling around the sides it seems.  I haven't tried it yet but I am pretty sure you could boil pasta in this thing if you don't feel like using a pot on the stove (my stove takes freaking forever boil water for some reason, so this was kind of important for me).  The only con is along to top there was a tiny bit of the coating that came off - but not a lot and it was not where food goes - probably caused by putting the lid on or something - so I knocked a star off for that.  I think it is still the best skillet I ever used so far - and I have tried a lot of different once in my life.  I would recommend this to others.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Review of InHome Cho Sub - Powerful subwoofer for your Echo: Are you tired of lackluster sound quality at your home dance parties? Look no further than the InHome Cho Sub - a powerful subwoofer designed specifically for use with compatible Echo devices.<br /><br />I recently hosted a house party with my family and decided to try out the InHome Cho Sub. Let me tell you, it was a game changer. The bass was thumping and the sound quality was crystal clear. We were able to dance the night away without any distortion or muddled audio.<br /><br />One crazy moment that stands out from the party involved my nephew attempting to breakdance on our hardwood floor. The bass from the InHome Cho Sub was so strong that it caused him to lose his balance mid-spin and fall to the ground. Thankfully, he wasn't hurt and we all had a good laugh about it afterwards.<br /><br />Setting up the subwoofer was a breeze - simply plug it in and connect it to your compatible Echo device via Bluetooth. It's compact size also makes it easy to move around as needed.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend the InHome Cho Sub for anyone looking to take their home dance parties to the next level. Your family and friends will thank you for investing in such high-quality sound equipment.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Oh holy hell! I am going to try and put into words, ever so graciously, what this book did to me.: Oh holy hell! I am going to try and put into words, ever so graciously, what this book did to me. This story had me giving an eye roll at the beginning to the slimy freak that was hitting on Emily, to fanning myself and laughing at the kiss and arrogance of Jake who is trying to help Emily out with the slimeball, then squirming in my seat yelling “RUN!” to Emily when she witnesses a brutal murder. THIS ALL HAPPENED AT THE VERY BEGINNING! What a way to start a story! I was stuck at this point. Very invested and couldn’t put this book down. Turns out Jake works for the FBI and is trying to take this murderer down but now has to save Emily and put her in witness protection for her safety. These two are both hawt and absolutely attracted to each other but no matter what, things go from bad to worse. There is a leak and the safe house has been compromised. Jake goes “rogue” and takes Emily to stay with his family in the boonies in Texas. The angst between these two is INTENSE! Jake has morals and the job comes first but Emily is slowly wearing him down. As with most stories our two main characters carry a ton of baggage. Emily has her reasons and is very stubborn and always a live in the moment type of person. She goes for what she wants and when she wants it. And if it doesn’t pan out she moves on. This personality really bumps heads with Jake who is very rule oriented and very by the book trying to protect her. As with most relationships when we argue things are said that we don’t necessarily mean but these two are under so much stress with all the craziness that is going on that things get crazy between the two. She is super stubborn and just wants to go back to the way things were before the murder but Jake is realistic and has to push her back to make her see reason. These two are constantly going back and forth getting under each other skins and trying to get into bed with one another. And all of the supporting characters from Emily’s friends Dale and Gina to Jake’s aunt and uncle and all of his childhood friends makes for an super funny and super eventful story. I absolutely recommend Tangled in Texas to everyone and am looking forward to reading the second. Alison Bliss is a new author to me and I am tangled up this story!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"it was easy to put up and maintain: We ordered this to keep up our golf game during the winter months. The previous reviews stated that the first assembly was a challenge to figure out, but after that, it was easy to put up and maintain. We found this to be true. We laid all the parts out on the garage floor (none missing) and tried to follow the printed instructions. We ended up going to YouTube for a demonstration video. With some trial and error (does the net go this way? that way?) we figured it out (thanks to the video). The net is durable and strong. You can every club into it, from short irons to driver, and the ball - a real ball, even - bounces back. This assumes you hit the ball straight :). It is easy to fold up, although it pays to be taller that 5-feet so you can more easily reach the poles that hold the net up.

I would not recommend this to anyone and certainly won't but them again.,2.0,Office_Products,0,24
"Wow: Having just finished reading this book, I'm having a hard time even formulating words for a review. Jack Estes' writing takes you not only into Vietnam and the war, but into his heart and head as well.  Everyone needs to read this book, especially those who know and love a veteran (of any war). The language is rough, but the man's personal integrity stayed intact throughout. My hat's off to Mr. Estes. Welcome home!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

I didn't try the esty mugs until Thanksgiving and had purchased 2 more from Amazon.  Well oops!  The Amazon mugs had a difference and were much better!  They had the foot prints as well as much more magical lettering.  I wished now I had purchased all 4 from Amazon!  Now they are out of stock and I have two kiddos with the not so good mug and 2 kiddos with the better mug!!!! Can't win for loosing!

"AMAZING PRODUCT: Here are the things that I liked about the Nexus 7 -<br />1) Jelly Bean (4.1) is really good<br />2) The higher resolution HD screen is great for reading and watching videos.<br />3) If you are heavily into the Google ecosystem, it's a breeze to set it up.<br />4) Android in general is more customizable with widgets etc.<br />5) I was able to download most of the iOS apps that I use frequently with some exceptions. More on that later.<br />6) I liked the auto-update feature on Android. It's an option that you can tick while downloading an app. It automatically downloads updates to that app.<br />7) I liked the notification system and realized why iOS decided to replicate it.<br />8) I also liked the shortcuts<br /><br />I chose the nexus because I don't like the hype of everyone who praises apple products I think it's just status symbols that drive people behind those products yes they may have certain features however this product is great and seems to be just as good",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Decent Bag for the Price: This bag is a little bit nicer than I was expecting it to be. It seems to be holding up well, doesn't have a horrific smell, and all the parts are where they are supposed to be. I can fit my 13'' laptop and notebook in it easily, though anything cylindrical (like a coffee thermos) makes the bag distorted and more difficult to carry. It stays on my shoulder well since the strap is thin, but the strap is a little too short to wear cross-body. All in all I like it, and have been using it as a briefcase for the last week with no issues. It seems like it will hold up well in the future.",4.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"Not Happy After 3 Months: We took out a Bose surround system as we wanted to free up shelf space. The Bose system worked well for us so decided, after reading reviews, to go with this soundbar. Setting it up was tedious. The app could not connect to SB after many retries. My ipad bluetooth could see the SB but the app did not. Called Bose for help. They were suppose to return call. Never did. Finally gave up after several calls. So much for Bose customer support. I had to disconnect everything to remove tv from wall and reposition to make a place for the SB. After plugging in everything and turning on tv the SB was working. So it has worked for a week. Sound is ok but takes some getting used to after surround. The ""full, rich"" sound some reviewers posted is not my experience. Even after all this time it will come on and no sound. Not sure why. This problem persists. For example, we can watch TV at night and it works ok. Next morning, turn it on, no sound. This happens on a regular basis. Our procedure is to turn it on and after it boots up and tv comes on select source. One thing that is bothersome is there is a brief light when you turn it on but does not stay on. I would prefer some indication it is on. So sometime we have to turn on tv speakers to get sound. This is of course irritating considering the cost. I think Bose is coasting on past success.",1.0,Electronics,0,12
"Feels secure enough: If you have reasonable expectations and don’t leave it completely unattended for long stretches, it works as expected. The reason I can’t give five stars is the design. The bag is too big to put in a purse or smaller draw sting back packs, so the only way to carry it conveniently is to carry a larger back pack which defeats the purpose or carry like a lunch sack which isn’t convenient for long stretches. I think adding a carry strap so it can be carried over the shoulder would be a plus. Also adding a pocket or two for quick access when not used as your vault would make it easier to use as a all day bag rather than just a place to lock your valuables would make this that much better. Btw - I bought the draw string back pack they offer as well, which is why I know carrying both is a pain.",4.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"A new way to sit: My physical therapist actually recommended I look into a kneeling chair to help with lower back and posture problems that come from working a job where I sit in front of a computer all day. Already have a standing desk, so this was purchased to help compliment that option. And so far, I really like it. I can feel the difference instantly in my back when I use the kneeling chair compared to using a regular chair.<br /><br />Of note: I don’t use the kneeling chair all day. I like to switch it up, so I might stand for a bit and then revert back to the kneeling chair for about 30-40 minutes before standing or sitting in a regular chair. The variation in positions throughout the day seems to work best for me and also keeps me consistently focused on maintaining good posture.<br /><br />The chair itself is comfy and sturdy. Haven’t had any problems making adjustments to the height as needed. And assembly was easy enough, especially considering that I’m far from handy with tools. The one feature I didn’t love was the back-support pad (the top kinda jabbed into my back) so I removed it and it’s all good now.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Georgian Great Gals: Loved this book. Filled in the gaps for me on the Hanoverian women. I knew a bit about Queen Caroline and her daughter who died in childbirth. What a different world if she and her little boy had survived. Her birth process was supposed to have been completely botched. The research was impressive - especially when you look at the lists at the back.<br />I especially love and enjoy women’s history and even more when so much detail and academic research has gone into the process. I learned so much about something I had huge gaps in. Thank you. How you managed to disentangle and wade through the murky spaghetti that was the Germanic European family connections, I do not know. When looking at the plates, there is a very strong Windsor (Mountbatten) resemblance - which is astonishing- then again perhaps not, when you consider all the Cousin marriages until VERY recently.<br />Thanks so much.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

You have to route your own cords thru (which I was expecting and that’s fine) but to do so you have to thread them thru this small/tight metal grip that started stripping the coating on my cable when I tried to pull it thru/adjust it. Also, the bottom of the phone holder is so low to the base that the charging cable bends at an awkward angle and gets damaged. It then gets “stuck” after being there all night and is a huge pain trying to disconnect the phone. The phone has gone flying several times just trying to detach the cable… I’ve also had to lift the entire unit to get it unstuck, which made a big mess of the cords. I was really looking forward to having one spot to charge everything but it was not worth trying to save a few bucks.

"Better than expected on first day.: I received this today and I'm a happy camper, so far.  I have been having severe neck issues for over 5 years.  I put this puppy on for about 20 minutes and felt some relief.  I've been taking some serious pain meds and have some serious hopes I can cut them back.  I figured for $15.00, it was worth the gamble.  I'm hoping this has a long life.  As some have posted in the past, eating batteries can make this expensive pain relief.  I have rechargeable batteries on hand which one would think this would be the least expensive way to go in the long run.  I would suggest having three sets of rechargeable on hand, once you think this unit will work for you.  I'm going to give this a 30 day test to see how it holds up with hopes this is a keeper.  I am more than pleased for my first day of use.  I have hopes of coming back after my test period and upgrade my review to five stars.  UPDATE:  I have a neighbor that has similar neck issues as I do.  After telling him about my results, he asked me if I could order him one, which I did.  I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that these hold up.  Should I ask Amazon for a referral fee?...........lol.  UPDATE:  8/17/15.......I just got off the phone with my neighbor and he just loves it......getting the same results as I have.  I seem to get the best results lying down and taking the weight of my head off of my neck.  I push the vibrator right into the pain area, both sitting and lying down.

"a thriller that you DON'T want to miss!: Carpe Librum Review:<br /><br />Sophie Fahy is a traditionally published Author, based in the United Kingdom. This novel has just been released, so go check it out on Amazon.<br />if you have instagram, please go give her a a follow and shout out, she is seriously the sweetest thing.<br />instagram: www.instagram.com/authorfahy<br /><br />The synopsis for this book, which is a thriller and mystery:<br />""Life is not always black and white, sometimes it's a thousand shades of grey.<br />Seventeen year old Alyssa Darlington has always been a party girl: quick witted, fierce, and very smart; with a strong future ahead of her. but after surviving a brutal attack at her best friends end of the summer house party, the only thing that seems fitting for Alyssa is revenge.<br />And when this becomes twisted reality, it's easy for the shadows to take over.<br />After something so traumatic, Alyssa struggles to stay on top of the social ladder - climbing to the top is hard - trying to stay there while recently becoming partially blind, is even harder. there's a weight upon her shoulders. Quietly searching for answers, Alyssa unlocks memories and reveals secrets that should have been buried.<br />Three suspects. One Love. And a whole of family drama.""<br /><br />this book, was a whirlwind. not only did it have me completely hooked from page one until the every end, and have me guessing every existence of every single character, but i did not expect at all, the conclusion. and then the final chapter! like, i completely was not ready for that loop! but it was so incredibly good.<br />the dialogue between characters were exactly that of teenage girls and boys in America. every scene was so relatable, the arguments between friends, the emotions of crushes, the heartbreak of losing friends. it entwines a family dynamic of an absent mother and a father trying to do everything that he can for his daughters, all while the other parent is off holding secrets to herself.<br /><br />anyway, back to the book.<br />Alyssa goes to her best friends end of the summer party with her other best friend, Tommy. who she thought she would end up with, and things go wrong when alcohol is involved. Alyssa finds herself in the garage later that time, when something terrible happens, and she is attacked by someone unknown. she falls unconscious after reaching out to someone she thought cared about her, asking for his help, and he leaves her. she is found a little while later, in a bloody, sick mess, and taken to the hospital. while there, she is told that she will be partially blind, until she goes fully blind. she is left to recovery in a fit of anger by what has happened to her, when she is suppose to start her senior year.<br /><br />she returns to school, not wanting anyone to know about her impairment, except her best friend, Noelle, who is helping her get through this. all while Alyssa is trying to put the pieces together about what happened that night, and seeing the school counselor, who is filling her head with ideas of what happened, while she is fighting her memory. through these chapters, these characters that were involved in the party, intermingle, and Alyssa finds out who are really on her side of things and want to help her.<br /><br />but then suddenly, she remembers. she remembers everything about that night and what happened to her. what she saw, what was said, it all came flooding back. and i guarantee it was nothing at all that you saw coming whatsoever. the last few chapters had me completely appalled and shocked. i closed the book after reading the last sentence and had to remind myself to breathe a little because it was THAT insane. what to know what happened to Alyssa that night?<br /><br />head on over to Amazon and purchase your copy of Through Her Eyes by Sophie Fahy. today. :)",4.0,Books,1,7

It is a really study pan. With the rear being the highest point at just over nine inches high it should have been more than adequate for my kitty's needs. Unfortunately he has decided that he must place his front paws on the low end and stand up to do his business. I'm back to looking for another option in a size that will fit the condo and foil his ""stand up act"".<br /><br />Also, just a note:<br /><br />When researching this pan before purchase, I noticed that several listings for this pan exist in its various colors and sizes but not all listings post the dimensions. Here they are:<br /><br />This listing is for a ""medium"" size pan which also has the exact same measurements as the size listed by the manufacturer as ""large""; the ""Large"" size measures 18.6 in. x 14.7 in. x 9.8 in.<br /><br />The ""Jumbo"" size measures 21.2 in. x 17.3 in. x 10.3 in.<br /><br />Edited to add: Manufacturer - PetMate (sometimes also listed as Doskocil)<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you in making your selection.",3.0,Pet_Supplies,0,26

"Basic knit gloves with some texture on the plan and fingers: These are fine, I thought they would be more substantial and water proof, but they are knit gloves. They are a little more substantial than the super cheap ones you can buy and the tacky texture on the palm and fingers is nice. The ability to keep gloves on and use touch screen devices is okay, but half the time it is just easier to take off the gloves to use my touch screens because they don’t pick up my touch with the gloves on unless I tap several times.

"Sound not as impressive as the design and build: Ordered these because i loved the aesthetic of them.  The colors are on point and the shape / design is amazing and very attractive to me.  I ordered these along with 2 other pair to compare with the intention of keeping one.  They fit pretty snug the head, almost a little too tight for me but once they were on for a min, even though i didn't wear them for long, i wasn't bothered by them at all.  The first thing you'll notice when listening is a pretty muffled sound quality.  It's sort of like if you've been watching an HDR tv and all the colors are popping off and are super vibrant, and then you go to a TV that doesn't have it, everything seems dull... These are def dull.  Pretty bummed because i was vibing hard with the look of them.  They covered my whole ear and looked super dope on me but just couldn't justify keeping them with such a poor listening experience.  Went with the rosewood and camel leather SIVGAs instead.  They bump and are super crispy.  Will try a set of higher end Sennheisers in the future for sure because i have heard great things about the 600s.",3.0,Electronics,0,12

"Sci-Fi, masterfully crafted alien species, action, romance, and light comedy: Genetically engineered Terran surgeon Cherijo Gray Veil-Reever now has a bounty of four million standard credits on her head.  Cherijo, who now goes by the name Jarn of Akkabarr, her husband Duncan Reever, and their child Marel have taken shelter with Jarn's Joranian HouseClan for the time being, but Jarn worries that she's put her Jorenian family in jeopardy.<br /><br />After betrayal by Duncan Reever's old friend Aleksei Davidov, Jarn and Duncan, are stranded outside the domed colony of Trellus, situated on an uninhabitable rock of a planet.  They have thirty days to find the whereabouts of the Odnallak shape-shifter or Alek will destroy the entire colony, Jarn and Duncan with it.  The Odnallak are hunted throughout the galaxies because their bone dust is a deadly poison; the reason every being wants the race destroyed.<br /><br />Jarn takes residence with Mercy, who's claimed her as salvage and taken her to her residence which is Trellus's only House Of Ill Repute.  Mercy's business manager and lover is an Omorr named Cataced (who goes by Cat).  Duncan was claimed by Drefan, who runs the Games dome and simulates battles for entertainment.<br /><br />Aside from having only thirty days to find the Odnallak, the inseparable couple discover another deadly threat to the quarantined colony of Trellus: a Sovant is loose among them, disguising itself as a colonist until it sheds its dead skin to move to the next host.  Mercy and Drefan, along with a remarkable being named Swap, take up with Jarn and Duncan's cause, helping them complete their mission in return for their help to rid the planet of the Sovant and Davidov's unnecessary quarentine.<br /><br />'Omega Games' is the eighth book in the StarDoc series.  I can never wait until the release of the next book, then tear through the book so fast I'm left breathless and again waiting for the next release.  S.L. Viehl has created the perfect sci-fi series (especially for women), combining Science fiction, medical mystery, superbly imagined aliens, unique planet environments, snappy dialogue, descriptive prose, high action, romance, and comedy, turning it all into a fantastically entertaining reading adventure.  She still has a tendency to use slaves a lot in relation to Jarn and brutal game arenas in relation to Duncan, but in 'Omega Games' she has lightened up on this repetitive trend.  In 'Rebel Ice', the sixth book, Cherijo was in a fatal accident and regenerated as Jarn of Akkabarr.  I was very disappointed in that book because I liked Cherijo much better than the reincarnated Jarn.  I still do.  In 'Plague Of Memory', Viehl began combining the two personalities and in 'Omega Games' she continues to do so, much to my satisfaction bringing more and more of the original Cherijo back into Jarn's memory and personality.<br /><br />'Omega Games' introduces a new society of aliens and Terrans living in a tightly-woven colony, like Jarn and Duncan arriving in a small town, and is a unique addition to the series.  You'll greet old friends and meet new ones.  I can't say enough about StarDoc and Viehl's distinctive contribution to the world of Space Opera novels.  I highly recommend this book, as well as the prior seven novels of the series.  Enjoy!!",5.0,Books,1,7

"Believe it or not, I actually loved the movie...: In my experience, if something exists as both a book and a movie, whichever I encounter first is the one that I like best and &quot;The Postman&quot; is no exception. I do feel that the Costner film would have benefitted GREATLY from the detailed explanation of the circumstances which led to society's collapse and the rise of the Holnists which Brin provides in his novel. However, by trimming the fat from the novel (a priesthood of timid computer nerds, a brooding hippie-cyborg)Costner actually created a more believeable story.<br /> It has been stated several times that the novel's greatest weakness is that Brin tries to cram too many themes into too small a space. The novel goes from being an engrossing study into societal decay and the power of myth to inspire hope to a treatise on male/female social dynamics in the space of a few pages without us understanding why. Likewise, Brin transfers the source of horror surrounding the evil Holnists from their ghoulish and all-too-plausible socio-political beliefs to an a contrived, overused device of man fusing with machine to create the ultimate evil. Like many others, I also found the ending to be rushed and unsatisfying.<br /> However, I overall I really did like this story very much. Try not to view it and the movie as the same story, but two entirely seperate imaginings of how the same story *might* have happened. A very worhtwhile read for any fan of speculative or apocalyptic ficiton.",3.0,Books,0,7

Considering that you need to push the ladder up from the bottom to stand it up against a wall, the majority of those pounds will be over your head, so very difficult to maneuver.<br /><br />I took it apart into two sections and it is still a big effort to stand up.<br /><br />Definitely not worth the $$$.

It’s simple and it works well to cover better than OEM.: I would recommend it because it’s covers just a little bit bigger than the OEM one so if you have that little extra non painted space from your old thermostat that you want to cover this one does the job. When I say a little it’s literally maybe a half to a quarter of an inch bigger all around  than the OEM one so it just went over what I needed to go over which means the factory one wouldn’t have covered it all. At least for my left over unpainted surface left from my old thermostat.,5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"A new ""classic"": I highly praise Oprah for using this book for her book of the month club. People who never even thought about picking up this book, did so because of her. I have seen teenagers and senior citizens of all colors reading this book (all over the city where I live). I was very glad to see a classic being brought back and ""reinvented"" all over again. Because of Oprah so many more people picked up this book.<br /><br />I have found the book wonderful. The language, style of writing and the story absolutely took my breath away and definitely kept me interested until the very last page.<br /><br />The characters and the plot are so well developed that it was easy to follow andunderstand. The story is absolutey amazing, how one women's beauty and choices had an effect on so many people. Anna is an amazing character whose beauty almost radiates through the pages that it is described on.<br /><br />The love Anna has for her son, her lover, brother and others is incredible. Her love guides her actions and she often finds herself torn between her love for the people around her.<br /><br />Some other characters that are very amazing: Dolly and her constant struggle with herself about her husband, chidlren, and family affairs; Levin and his love for a woman who broke his heart; Kitty who after an embarrasing courting flop finds true love; Karenin, and his constant worry about how his actions look in front of God, and society; Oblonsky and his love of having a good time; and of course Vronsky whose lust and love change the lives of many.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, with a wonderful story about love, pride, family, and one's own torment about the decisions made in everyday life.<br /><br />This version of Anna Karenina has very helpful endnotes that help explain some of the politics, religion, and life during that time in russia.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Heads or Tails?  Tails this time....: Saga has been, since 1980 or so, one of my favorite bands.  They still are.  But &quot;Marathon&quot; won't be one of the CDs that makes it into regular rotation on my jukebox.  There are a couple promising songs here - the title track among them - and even a little acoustic guitar that adds a texture not seen often in Saga recordings.  But between the overly simplistic lyrics and the very flat production characteristics of this disc, this is not one of the group's best efforts.  This project was, according to the liner notes, done entirely by the band - engineering, mixing, etc. - and the lack of an outside influence is apparent.  Michael Sadler's voice seems far too &quot;covered up&quot; by unneeded backing vocals, the keyboard work is not up to the standard of even recent recordings such as &quot;Full Circle,&quot; and Ian's guitar work is less than what we've come to expect.  Points are to be given for the CD artwork, however, and for the band still doing what they love to do after 27 years or so.  The collective body of work is exemplary, and a song or two from this one make it into the &quot;listen to it&quot; pile.  All that said, here's hoping Saga makes a North American appearance or two now that the European tour has ended....",3.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,0,8

Whew that was a long ride.: Whew that was a long ride. This author does not skip on content or pages. Say No More picks up where Say You're Sorry left off except this time Mercy Callahan is the main character. We'd learned about her and Gabriel's upbringing in a cult in his book and how it ripped apart their worlds. When Mercy was finally reunited with her brother Gabriel years of being told he left her and their mother with the cult to suffer along with being taken by a serial killer had her running from him and his best friend Rafe who she was starting to have feelings for.<br /><br />Now that some time has past she makes the decision along with her best friend to return to Sacramento to try and make amends with her brother and to ask Rafe's forgiveness in how she left him. Problem is an evil from her past with the cult once he found out she is alive is hellbent on taking her back and has no problem in leaving a very large line of bodies in his wake.<br /><br />There is so much that happens in this book. Besides the suspense and the bodies piling up there is also a lot of emotions as Mercy and Gabriel deal with their past and learn to forgive the other along with themselves. Rafe and Mercy's journey also is an emotional one.<br /><br />This isn't the end of the cult thread. I figure there is at least one more with Tom Hunter as the lead. Long time fans of the series (as in 24 books ago) will remember that Tom was Max Hunter's son who is now all grown up and a FBI Agent.,4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"nimble drive: Hi all,  So I got this Corsair drive. Yep, neat heatsink, wish all manufacturers would provide this type of heatsink.<br /><br />Nope, not a gamer. As for read/write speed, didn't meet spec. With crystal benchmark, read/write 70040, about the same for the Kingston Renagade, continuous write, a little above 5800 megs, not the 6800 advertised spec. Now, this is with a drive using 28% capacity. As any drive gets fuller, the speeds will drop.<br /><br />As for this drive getting hot, yep, and the heatsink is right there to take away the heat. It wasn't really bad, just a little warm.<br /><br />Now, what's interesting is how the drive performed. If this is any indication to its performance, it did seem to be faster than some of the drives tested. when opening webpages. How well will it last. Don't know.<br /><br />The system here isn't anything fancy. It's a MSI Pro MATX board, 16GB of Corsair RAM, a Socket 1200 Intel I5 at 4.9GB, a couple of Optical drives, and this drive. That's it. Other than the great heatsink, this drive is up there with the other $99 priced drives. I might go back to Amazon and seek a replacement to hopefully get that advertised 6800 megs speed. The SK Hynix for read/write, was a little above 7000 megs, and almost  if memory serves me right, for continuous write at just under the 6500 meg mark.<br /><br />Verdict Would I buy again, maybe, If this didn't have the great heatsink, no I wouldn't buy this one. There are others out there that seem to do just as well. It's the heatsink that does it.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Utterly Arresting Every Step of the Way: Occasionally, there are works of art or literature that defy simple classification. The brain breaks upon them like waves and they give up different secrets with each tide but never all the secrets and never all at once. These creations challenge as much as they entertain and ask for obsession as toll on the road to understanding.<br /><br />The Squirrel Machine by Hans Rickheit is just such an enigma. At face value, it is the tale of two brothers, Edmund, the elder, and William. They live in a small New England town at approximately the turn of the 20th century, and the village's desperate normalcy acts as backdrop for the boys' increasingly strange explorations. The Torpor brothers are creators, Edmund an inventor and William a musician who plays bizarre instruments of his brother's design. There are organs created from organs, music that emanates from pigs' heads and cow carcasses, and an attempt at a recital on the ""Bovine Resonator"" results in a riot. Misunderstood by the town's inhabitants and desperate to escape the attentions of their widowed mother (whose principle hobby seems to be painting stylized pornography), the two brothers eventually discover and retreat to a labyrinthine complex hidden beneath their home.<br /><br />Plot is a nebulous concept here. How much of the story is metaphor, how much literal, and what part hallucination, all remain unclear and seem to shift during and between readings. The tale here lies in the telling. It is the characters' journeys, the enigmas that they encounter and create, that ultimately compel the reader onward to the unknown, the uncomfortable, and the unclear.<br /><br />The art is fantastic in many senses of the word. It is clean yet complex, always intricate but never overwhelming. Mechanical and organic forms are interwoven in complex creations. Rickheit's vision is consistently compelling. Strange clockwork creations are fused with biology and windup toys are wedded to dissection samples. This is biotech steampunk where forms seem to whirr, click, and ooze right off the page.<br /><br />The Squirrel Machine is ultimately an exploration of the mind. It delves into the imagination, unearthing fear, sex, repression, and finally, if not redemption, then reconstitution. Surreal, gorgeous, and both satisfying and confounding, The Squirrel Machine is a hypnotic, occasionally repulsive, always entertaining, and wildly creative graphic novel. It does not invite rereading so much as demands it, and each encounter reveals new and different details and interpretations. This book is a wonderful mystery, a basket of questions, a wealth of enigmas, and it looks utterly arresting every step of the way.<br /><br />-- Christian Zabriskie",5.0,Books,1,7

With this cover, I can answer the phone without having to open it, and I can talk with the closed cover against my face. It has a clear window that shows the date, time, and who is calling. I do, however, have to open it to dial out. Also, it might be a nuisance having to hold the cover out of the way if you use the camera a lot. I do not recommend it for people who drop their phones.

"A must for any Disney Channel Zombies fan!: Singing zombie Addison was a hit with my daughter, who is a huge fan of the Disney Zombies movies. This version of Addison is dressed in her ""werewolf costume"" in Zombies 2 --suede pants, shimmery top, cute two-toned boots and a fur-lined vest. There are great details with her makeup, studded belt and bracelets, too. The necklace is painted onto the doll, and you press the pendant for the doll to sing ""Call To The Wild.""<br /><br />Don't expect Addison to sing the whole song, though! She only sings the line twice, and that's it!<br /><br />This doll has bendable joints at the ankles and wrists as well as the elbows and knees, so you can really pose Addison many ways.

"Loved it; One Sewing Defect: My company bought me a monster 17.3&#34; Dell Laptop.  Of course, it didn't fit my long time work bag.  So I bought the SwissGear 1900 bag for my new computer.  Guess what?  IT FITS!!  The TSA SmartScan pocket is way cool.  Can't wait to use it on an upcoming trip.  My Kindle fits in the tablet pocket.  This bag has so many pockets and containers, so many places to put things.  LOTS OF SPACE!<br /><br />The only miserable thing is a sewing defect on the cup-holder pocket (see picture). It's very sad to see such shoddy workmanship on a brand new bag.  I bought a name brand bag because I thought it would be better than some cheap-o Amazon special.  Come on, SwissGear!  Don't be mediocre like everyone else.  The worst part is that it's not bad enough to go thru the hassle of sending it back.<br /><br />Still recommend it. Its a nice bag.

Magnet won’t stick or hold: I was really disappointed with this item. I had one for over 2 years with no problems.

"Dave Robicheaux gris gris gumbo ya ya!: My first introduction to James Lee Burke's Big Easy dectective, Dave Robicheaux, was via television, in Heaven's Prisoners.  There were a<br /> handful of truly unique characters...I wanted more<br /><br /> Dave Robicheaux is a basically honest cop, with a<br /><br /> tad too much humanity for the Southern Louisiana gator tank in which he swims.  Shades of Travis McGee:  Detectives on the take, women who aren't what they seem to be and bottom-feeding psychopaths who should be long gone, but are they?<br /><br /> At night, Dave wrestles with various demons from<br /><br /> Viet Nam, his murdered wife, and sundry flotsam<br /><br /> and jetsom of the Big Easy.  From beyond the (watery)grave come Cajun homilies from his dad.<br /><br /> The very best thing about A Morning For Flamingos<br /><br /> is the writing.  You taste the hot, yeasty beignets from Cafe du Monde, then lick your fingers and shake the powdered sugar from your<br /><br /> clothes.  My, that chicory-infused coffee smells<br /><br /> good. It's a tad bit humid, but the pink-tinged<br /><br /> sunrise and the bayou barbeque draw you in, you.<br /><br /> Burke takes you with Robicheaux, as he tumbles<br /><br /> down a ravine after being shot, to a hot pillow<br /><br /> place in the parish, and most of all, inside the<br /><br /> head of the battered, taking sobriety a day at a<br /><br /> time detective with more conscience than survival<br /><br /> skills.<br /><br /> Like cowboy poetry, Burke's New Orleans is raw yet<br /><br /> beautiful.  There's a terrible bunch of snakes that sizzle and hiss inside Robicheaux, yet he reaches out to a character most would paint with<br /><br /> broad &quot;bad guy&quot; strokes, but then you just never<br /><br /> know...The ending was truly satisfying, and if you<br /><br /> are new to this writer or series, this won't be<br /><br /> your last trip to New Iberia.",5.0,Books,1,7

If you plan to ride a mountain bike or go on bike rides with bumpy terrain, I’d suggest buying a clamp for the light as I’m not certain the silicone strap will hold that well in these instances.

"Stop back breaking Fall raking: I have a riding mover that pick up leaves.  Problem is that after the rain the ground is soft and using a riding mover leaves deep ruts in the lawn.  Solution is to rake the leave is the soft areas.  This Lawn sweeper is ideal for large lawns, and has a wide pick up base.  It is ideal for even lawns, and if yours is uneven you may have to adjust the height.  Was fairly easy to build, instructions were well written.",4.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,1,25

I wanted to upgrade to a 1500W in order to squeeze some more power out of them (1200W is cutting it close for 4x r9 290x). I plugged in this 1500W PSU and it couldn't handle 4 of my cards running at 100%. My fault for not noticing the crappy setup they have going on over here with 6 rails total: 2 rails at 20A and 4 rails at 30A each.<br /><br />Unless you're willing to do some extensive trial and error to load balance your cards, I would stay away from this.

"Want to Feel Good?: I rec'd my 1st pound of Chia Seeds on Tuesday morning...started to take the chia seeds that morning, a Tbsp in approximately 10 oz. of H2O.

By that 3rd day I had more stamina, lost that bloated feeling, and just generally just felt good. Did not and do not feel hungry, also reduced cravings, I wasn't looking for that snack at night.

"great buy, match my son's uniform color perfectly, high quality, don't cause blisters: Bought these for my son who is a size 10- 10 1/2 in shoes and the first time he put them on, the heel was kind of up by his ankle.. however with washing and adjusting he really loves them and they look quite snazzy with his maroon travel uniform.  We told the rest of the team about these, so a few other players bought them as well, however some could not as #2 wasn't offered.. weird!  However, for us we are very pleased with how these coordinate with his uniform and the fit and comfort are great as well.  He had 3 games Saturday back to back and wore these all day, and I am happy to report no callouses or blisters.<br /><br />Just be sure that when they are pulled up, you will be able to see the numbers because with the uniform shorts nowadays that hang pretty low, you might just be wasting your money if the number is so high up that it gets covered by the back of the shorts.  On my son (who is 10 years old and about 5 feet tall) the number comes to about the upper calf, and the numbers show as his shorts hit above the bend at the back of the knee... however some teammates' shorts are longer and would cover that part of the calf so have your child try on the uniform shorts and decide from there.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Can a Good Witch Save an Evil Empire?: The second of Katya Reimann's books, this book starts off differently than the first, and takes us on a whole new journey.<br />The restless Gaultry Blass, serving as an honored guest in the court of the new Prince of  Tielmark. She secretly hopes for something to do, and gets it when she and  her sister foil an assassination attempt against the prince.  However, one  of the assassins from the Sha Muir nears death, and Gaultry saves his life.  In doing so, she gets her wish for &quot;something to do&quot;, as she  must take the spy back to enemy soil in an attempt to save the life of her  friend Martin Stalker.<br />Once again, we have a whole world to discover, and  it is refreshing to read about the Bissantry Empire from their point of  view.  Unlike the typical (and simplistic) good and evil, we can see the  way each country sees the other, and it is a theme that can apply to how we  see other people and other nations.  In the end, we wonder what influence  both the huntress and the assassin have on each other, and will this new  experience change the way the countries develop.<br />My only regret is that  we still do not get a feel for Gaultry's twin sister, Mervion, who could  and should be important in the development of the character.  I believe  that the twins were set up to explore the two personalities that women (and  men) feel, and yet we only see the side of the independent Gaultry, not  seeing the saavy Mervion, nor the relationship of the two sisters.  I hope  this is explored in future novels.<br />Overall, another enjoyable read.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Sexual Assault, Stereotyped Female Characters and BAD Writing: An individual in my book club picked this for our October read, and seeing the reviews I had hope for this novel. But upon finishing it (or at least reading up to the point where the rape of a major character occurs, which is close to the end) I was disgusted with how Hansen portrays female characters and his extremely poor ability to tell a riveting story. There were essential points in the plot that didn't hang together and were shaky at best. His attempt at writing a romantic sex scene was fumbling and seemed, frankly, out of place. I lost count of the times he described a woman's physical appearance and attractiveness and tried to make up for it by calling her 'intelligent.'<br /><br /> Even though the bigfoot genre is its own weird little niche there's always potential to take an overdone subject and turn it into something truly compelling and fascinating. This book is definitely neither compelling nor fascinating. Not worth the price listed for Kindle, and is grossly overpriced for a hardcover.<br /><br /> I don't know how this book got sold to Simon and Schuster. I really have no idea. But if the author continues to write fiction I'd suggest he take a writing class and re-consider the place of wanton sexual assault in his future writing.",1.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"A book with an important message for kids: sports can forge connections across social boundaries: Score! Clare Hodgson Meeker's simple but sweet story about soccer and what it means to one young boy will touch kids of all ages and levels of experience with the game, and maybe even a few parents. Kids who already love soccer - especially fans of the Seattle Sounders - will be riveted, and those who'd never played could be inspired to start.<br /><br /> The book follows Todo, a young boy who moves with his family from his old home in Kenya to a new one in Seattle. He loves soccer and feels a special connection with the Sounders from the beginning, and in Seattle he is quickly sought out by the coach of a local team. On the team Todo makes friends, helps the others learn teamwork and cooperation, and navigates a rivalry with an antagonistic boy who is also in his class at school.<br /><br /> When Todo strikes up a friendship with a player for the local girls team, Todo's sister Adila wonders if their parents would allow her to play on a team as well. Throughout the story, Todo's skill and love of the game helps him find friends and community, and to forge a special connection with his new home. Meeker's writing makes this simple story heartfelt.<br /><br />The main story is interspersed with short profiles of different players on the Seattle Sounders, including favorite position and a short quote from each. If you are a Sounders fan, you will find these profiles interesting, but for reader who doesn't follow the Sounders, the profiles may distract from the central story of Todo and his love of soccer.<br /><br /> For boys and girls enthusiastic about soccer, sports, or the Seattle Sounders, this book is a shoe-in. It effectively communicates the fun and importance sports can have, and deftly touches on issues of sexism and racism that middle-schoolers may have to confront without becoming moralistic or overly dark. Most importantly, young readers will come away from the book with the message that sports can be a way to forge connections across social boundaries and make dreams come true.<br /><br /> Well-written and touching, ""Soccer Dreams"" could serve as a starting point for a conversation about some serious real-world issues, or simply a fun way to share a love of soccer. Either way, it's a winner.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

Only con is I had to park my vehicle in the garage and use a direct plug to vacuum the vehicle. It doesn't have any utilities for car ports or USB ports, so if you don't have a car garage with wall ports, or let alone a garage period, this product may not be for you. You can use a car charger port device  but the vacuum uses so much power that the electricity in the car might not be enough. It certainly was not for me.

"It's good, but some more customer-friendly rules required: I have used a LaCie 301827U d2 Quadra 1 TB eSATA External Hard Disk before.

Connected it to my iMac with the eSATA card that I purchased and it started up immediately. There's also a USB2 and Firewire 400 / 800.

"Meteor House does it again: I have to really hand it to the team at Meteor House, the Worlds of Philip Jose Farmer series could have just been a series of books with just new stories set in the Worlds of Philip Jose Farmer and I'm sure most people would have been quite happy (given the quality of stories that have appeared I'd go as far as very happy) but the decision was made to have the stories but to also explore the man behind the stories.<br /><br />This volume explores Phil's trickster nature. Not surprisingly Venus on the Half-Shell by ""Kilgore Trout"" is featured prominently in these articles but Farmer's tricks extend beyond that. One article was written by the fictional author Jonathon Swift Summers III (who is the grandson of another fictional author) of a fictional author Kilgore Trout (borrowed from another author Kurt Vonnegut jnr) talking about the work of Philip Jose Farmer. I'll give you a minute to mull on that.<br /><br />Brain hurting yet? I've mulled over this a few days myself and I'm still processing it all especially since Summers gets upset that another of Farmer's fictional authors Tom Wode Bellman got to write the introduction to the collection Venus on the Half-Shell and Other Stories. Bellman writes his own article denying his fictionality.<br />It's perhaps a good thing that Spider Robinson's Dog Day Evening wasn't in this volume. Robinson makes use of Summer's Ralph Von Wau Wau who suggests that he writes science fiction under the name of Philip Jose Farmer. It appeared in volume 2.<br /><br />That's the ultimate trick of this book; it leaves you questioning just what is real.<br /><br />As always there are some excellent stories that explore the fictional worlds that Farmer created. All four are excellent but I loved Eckert's The Wild Huntsman. There are articles looking at some of the more unusual aspects of Farmer's stories such as Rick Lai's The Genuine Impostor.<br /><br />We are presented with a mystery, in Farmer's papers was a story under the penname of Charlotte Cordat-Marat. In 2011, another story under that name was discovered titled ""The Many Dooms of Harold Hall"" it appeared in the November 1965 issue of Bizarre Magazine. Farmer experts are divided if it was written by Farmer or not. I cannot say myself.<br /><br />Once again the Meteor House team have made an excellent book and worth getting.",5.0,Books,1,7

Mainly because they were always on TV and whenever I stumbled upon it, It was always mid way through.

"Coming to terms..: I really enjoyed this book even though it wasn't my typical read.<br /><br />Maggie, almost 13, is finding herself amidst all the turmoil around her.  Her mother is also finding herself.<br /><br />I was really drawn into the characters' struggles.<br /><br />It may have been stereotyped for some, but for me, it was an eye-opening experience getting inside others lives this way.  Monica, Maggie's cousin, I came to almost hate and really pity someone so shallow and selfish. Connie, her mom, I felt so much sympathy for.  She seemed so depressed for the majority of the book.  I could understand why she was becoming attracted to Joe, a man from her past.  When one feels emotionally dead it is easy to become infatuated with someone who shows  attention and appreciates you.  Tommy, Maggie's dad, just seemed so detached.<br /><br />I could go on and on about this book..yes, it's stereotyped, but in a different way.<br /><br />On a different note, since I am a Christian and VERY picky about what I read or watch, I have to say that there are  quite a few GD words that was offensive to me.  I continued to read because I knew that that was how this family lived.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Clear explanations but not unbiased: The best thing about this book is that it is easier to follow than many of the other books that have been written on this topic.  One needs to be reasonably intelligent, but does not need a degree in political science, economics, or finance, in order to grasp the ideas presented.  The worst thing about the book is that it is clearly written by authors with an undeniable preference for the Democratic party.  One example: in classifying deficit spending by party, the authors choose to begin their analysis in 1980 and to ignore the recent past even though the book was published in 2011.  This allows them to blame the Republicans and exonerate the Democrats.  It's also worth noting that they do this by relying on a carefully chosen sample of 4 observations (3 Republicans: Reagan, Bush 1, and Bush 2; 1 Democrat: Clinton).  In a related vein, they choose to blame the huge deficits of 2009-2010 (and thereafter) on ""Bush era policy"" rather than on Obama presidency.  In the few places where President Obama is mentioned, it is argued that he inherited a bad economy that was caused by Bush and therefore the deficits under his presidency are not his fault.  I find this interesting because they don't give Reagan the same deniability even though he too inherited a pretty lousy economy.  Instead, Reagan is largely credited with creating the whole national debt problem.  I'm not a big fan of either party but I saw one professional review included on the book cover that claimed this book was ""unbiased"" and I just had to laugh.  In conclusion, I think this is a great book but one has to be aware of the authors' agenda.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Not as nice as my other Tevas: I got these Tevas to replace my worn out ones.  I don't know what the model was of the older ones, but they were the cheapest ones I could find at the time.<br /><br />When comparing the two, the straps are significantly narrower on the Pretty Rugged 2's, and they cut into my big toe.  The velcro is as wide on both of them, but the soft foamy under side, under the velcro, was only as wide as the velcro on the new shoes.  On the old shoes it was much wider and provided better padding from the velcro.  Just wearing them a few minutes around the house left a red dent in my big toe.<br /><br />They have an interestingly springy sole which felt like it might be comfortable if I had kept the shoes, but the arch support felt less supporting.<br /><br />Also, the triangle shaped piece of plastic that holds the straps together at the ankle was much smaller and had less padding than my older Tevas.",2.0,Unknown,0,32

"Relieved my chronic pain and stiffness of neck, traps, and upper back.: Quite amazing how quick and effective it has been. My problem areas never felt this great in YEARS. I've tried a different brand and type which has Mg Citrate, and while it seemed to work, a nightly dose almost always gave me nightmares (and I'm very tolerant to weird dreams, but these were just very bad) and they made me groggy in the morning. I wasn't able to tolerate using them for more than three days at a time, and eventually tossed it. Mg oxide's effects seemed minimal, while giving me loose stools even at moderate doses. After hearing about how great chelated Mg is, I decided to give this one a try, and I am very glad I did. I felt a remarkable difference in two days, while dosing only at 200 mg. My neck, traps, and upper back have not felt this relaxed in YEARS. Also, I noticed my tolerance to coffee has increased ever since taking these. I am able to drink more coffee as I used to years back, without experiencing excruciating muscle tightness in mentioned areas, accompanied by unusual feelings of anxiety/paranoia.<br /><br />So far I haven't experienced any noticeable side effects while dosing at 200 mg - 300 mg a day. No GI discomfort whatsoever, and no loose stools. The only thing I have an issue with are the size of the pills, along with pill coating that comes off quickly when you have it in your mouth. I just learned to chew on it to relatively fine and down it with water. It does taste and smell funny, but it's better than choking on these.

"A promising start, but ultimately disappointing: I thought this book was very good on Kerouac's French-Canadian family background, his childhood, young adult years, and his time in the merchant marines.  However, when I came to the part where Kerouac meets fellow writers and other friends, Johnson really lost me.  There were so many unnecessary details about their lives that the book became tedious and boring.  It was also unfortunate that Johnson could not use quotes from Kerouac's books, but had to paraphrase everything.  Like other reviewers have said, this made me want to abandon Johnson's bio and re-read some of Kerouac's amazing work.  I also didn't like how the book suddenly stopped at 1951.  I would have liked to read about the rest of his life, including the reaction to such a groundbreaking book like On The Road.",2.0,Books,0,7
"Beloved Hush Puppies slip ons replaced after 5 years: I don't usually get attached to things, especially clothes. I bought my first pair of Hush Puppies at DSW about 5 years ago and instantly loved them. They were so comfortable I actually felt guilty wearing them, as if I was breaking some age old rule about how dress shoes should feel on your feet. I bought them a full size smaller than I would any other shoe but the tight toe area loosened up after just a few weeks. Admittedly, the tops were more garment than shoe leather, but I pulled this off well until I wore through the soles, the stitching started coming loose, and the tops became ridiculously wrinkled (but never cracked).<br /><br />These aren't a direct replacement, but all the same concepts are there. They are harder to slip on that the old ones ever were, even though they are a half size bigger and are a little more formal looking. The shoes are almost too light. It's crazy really. There is now a pillowed insole which is an improvement that brings back that old feeling of somehow cheating. The extra half size makes my heel slip a little, more on one foot than the other. Size and width choices were limited. I would have gotten narrow if it had been available.<br /><br />Amazon rarely disappoints with price. These were a full $20 less than Zappos and, here's the kicker, they were shipped from Zappos who met Amazon Prime's stringent two day delivery requirements.<br /><br />In summary, these technologically advanced, super light, ridiculously comfortable dress shoes cost about half what I would pay locally. I probably won't wait 5 years to replace these however, since that was somewhat embarrassing. I will enjoy these while looking forward to what Hush Puppies has to offer a couple of years from now.",5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"Fantastic Brush, at Very Reasonable Price!: I had been using a pure badger hair brush and was very satisfied but decided it was time for an upgrade. Did some research and decided on giving the Parker Silver Tip a shot. WOW, am I glad I did. Reasonably priced for a silver tip, this brush is fantastic. I can't even begin to describe how soft and luxurious it feels on my face. After five shaves it hasn't shed a single hair. The ebony handle is a nice weight and looks great. And the brush came packaged very nicely. The stand it comes with is not the best but it certainly does the job and looks fine. I couldn't ask for anything more, Just a fantastic brush!",5.0,Beauty_and_Personal_Care,1,6

"64 and Counting: While most of this doesn't quite compare to CHAOS AND CREATION IN THE BACKYARD, it's still proof that Paul McCartney has been on an incredible creative streak.<br /><br />What I like most about the selection here is that there is only one ""sappy"" song (SEE YOUR SUNSHINE), and even that one is genuinely upbeat and ""feel-good"" in a way that doesn't get tiresome (by contrast, my only complaint with CHAOS was that it had at least one too many love songs). The other two (YOU TELL ME and GRATITUDE) sound, to me at least, drenched in bitter irony; while I try not to make comparisons to his Beatle years, these two songs have a disillusioned, RUBBER SOUL sensibility, continuing in the vein of RIDING TO VANITY FAIR only more subtle. It's often the case that the biggest romantics can also write the greatest kiss off songs.<br /><br />The classical arranging McCartney has been involved with really shows on other tracks, primarily MR. BELLAMY and HOUSE OF WAX (one of his best...ever...). I don't envy McCartney's having to balance his innate pop sensibility with both his ""high"" musical ambitions and rock 'n' roll desires, especially given the ridiculous expectations of his (often sycophantic) public, but he pulls it off quite well here.<br /><br />And I can't stop listening to DANCE TONIGHT.",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"A Consequential Nineteenth-Century European Conflict: The Franco-Prussian War was the largest European war between 1815 and 1914.  It was important geopolitically—it resulted in the establishment of the German Empire and ended the era of French dominance on the Continent.  This volume by Stephen Badsey is a good short history of the war.  It examines the relationship between the two countries and how it developed over the course of the nineteenth century, and the preparations (or lack thereof) of France and Prussia for war.  The book details the battles and campaigns of the war and its leading figures such as Napoleon III and Bismarck.  The war ended in a quick Prussian victory, and the volume recounts the settlement terms, the war's place in history, and its implications for the twentieth century.  The book is under a hundred pages, and provides an informative, basic understanding of this conflict.",5.0,Books,1,7

"No happy endings: No happy endings<br /><br />I have read every Annie Proulx book and will read whatever else she writes. Barkskins leaves me with lots of thoughts, questions, and worries.<br /><br />Proulx tells a three-century-long historical fiction in her vivid, lyrical prose. She takes us deep into the arboreal woods, plunders them, and knocks us over the head with a two-by-four, leaving us to wonder if all is lost.<br /><br />There are so many tragedies in the tale. Just as a character seems to be redeemed, he doubles down on his avarice. Just as lost souls are about to find themselves or each other, they quit or die. Just when you think a feminine hand at the helm will turn the ship around, she does the boys one better (or worse). And that’s as it should be in a story about humankind's relentless, unwavering destruction of the world’s timberland. The only thing more atrocious than the long-running rape is the heedlessness with which we did it and continue to do it.<br /><br />Proulx’s genius is to drill down deeply into only one of the world’s natural resources that have been consumed by man and forever lost. Trees are beautiful living things whose loss echoes and haunts. In Proulx's telling, humans are an invading species that sickens the entire ecosystem through selfish, thoughtless consumption.<br /><br />The planet is similarly wasted by man’s burning of the less-lovable fossil remnants of coal and oil.<br /><br />And so my questions and worries: Are we beyond redemption? Why did the rapacious European strain of the human species win the day, instead of the native strains that lived more harmoniously with their environment? Can we evolve (re-volve?) back to place? What am I to do?<br /><br />Barkskins tees up these thorny questions, but cannot provide the answers. Because the story continues.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Disappointed. I really wanted it to work for me.: I bought the iPod lamp, not the Bluetooth version. It had a good sound. The problem for me, was that when the radio alarm went off, even if you set the volume low, it would get very loud, and the lamp would come on. Maybe this is a good feature for heavy sleepers, but not for me. Also, the local radio station would constantly go out of tune. It was hit and miss. I purchased another iPod lamp clock radio from Hammacher Schlemmer. It is almost half the cost of this product, works well and is dependable, but the sound is tinny compared to the Ivation, which I returned.",2.0,Unknown,0,32

"The best phone protector ever: This is an excellent phone protector and case. It is rugged, easy to assemble and reliable in use. It snaps tightly at first but then it truly keeps all dust and particles away from the phone. Plus it looks good.

Once you compensate for the extra small layer between your finger and the phone it works like just fine. The retracting stand is sturdy and although it requires a sharp objects to open it, the mechanism is durable unlike others which are flimsy and do not last.

"Waste of Money and Time: I have been a Waterpik customer for at least 30 years...<br /><br />I bought this unit with the intent of using it when I travel.  Upon receipt, I followed the directions to a T and allowed the flosser to charge overnight before even turning it on.  A few days later, I went on vacation and kept the unit charged after use.  After a mere THREE DAYS OF USE, the flosser would not hold a charge and would barely spit out any water.<br /><br />Upon returning home, I called the toll free number provided by Waterpik and spoke with a customer service representative.  Elisha was polite and advised that she needed the serial number to proceed.  So, the following day, I brought the flosser to work with me and left the water reservoir and pick at home.  I then called back and spoke with Constance.  She never asked for the serial number and asked me to turn the unit on- which I did.  She then asked me to operate it WITH WATER in it...an absolutely ridiculous request to make of someone calling from work...just so that she could &#34;diagnose&#34; the problem.  In sum, I would need to make a THIRD call to Waterpik's customer service line.<br /><br />The third call isn't happening.  I don't have time for shenanigans.  I want things that a purchase to work.

"Saved myself a couple hundred bucks!: First of all, plan an afternoon and maybe meditate before doing this, because it can be very frustrating to remove the broken screen.  Watch plenty of youtube videos, have some razorblades standing by (not included in this kit), and gloves (my screen broke into many tiny pieces).  Removing the broken screen was by  far the hardest part of getting this thing done.  But once that is removed and you take the time to clean the surface of where the old screen was attached, this is pretty straightforward.  My one bit of advice would be to spend the few extra bucks to buy the screen with the thumbprint sensor built in.  That does feel a bit loose on mine, but it still works.  Very happy that i didn't pay 250 bucks to have the glass replaced at the apple store or a fix-it kiosk.  Take your time, and be prepared to be annoyed by how well engineered Apple makes their products.

My normal Grunt Style size is large because I have a bigger chest. I ordered an XXL since the large orders all said that is what they did and they fit snug. The shirt looks like a moo-moo on me LOL. I understand the logic of ordering up but the v-neck/shoulder/armhole area is way too big and the length was super long. In my opinion, I would only order my size (large) or possibly 1 size bigger (XL). I would not suggest ordering two sizes up.

"Best brushed WB Urethane - Hands Down: I've been an avid woodworker for over 30 years.  I used to spray almost all of my finishes until I found GF EF urethane.  The last several cabinet projects that I've done have turned out terrific because of this product.  I get a smooth handed rub look with little effort.  This products got rave reviews from Fine Woodworking a number of years ago, and that's when I made the change.  One of the previous reviewers used it outside on teak.  They used an interior product outside, so their results aren't surprising.  The product clearly states that it for INTERIOR use.  You have to read the label.  GF has an exterior product called Exterior 450.<br /><br />What I like about this product, is that it goes on easily, dries quickly and you can sand it inside of one hour and get a nice white powder.  I use the satin finish, yet I can rub it out and get a low luster satin finish, OR if I rub it out with 1200 or 1600 grit, I can get a high gloss, hand rubbed piano finish.  I've compare the last several cabinet projects to a factory finish and GF process that I've refined blows them away.  This is a wonderful product backed by a company where people actually pick up the phone to answer question.  I highly recommend it for the woodworking enthusiast.  You will never go back to spraying solvent based products.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"Tales of horror with Taboos attached: Massie manages to peel away many layers of humanity here in her collection called The Fear Report.  Would you have an intimate relationship with something less than a torso?  Would you let a traveling peddler give you a colonic?  What kind of treats does your family traditionally serve at Christmas time?  At what point does being sick become too sick?<br /><br />Massie's horror is inside the human soul rather than coming from the form of a monster.  Her characters have a slippery way of justifying their behavior that is a bit disturbing and more than a little intriguing.  Whether you belong to a backwoods family or are a descendent of an ancient South American tribe, you can find something there to rationalize any odd mentality.<br /><br />My favorites from this collection of thirty tales would be Stephen, Fixtures Of Matchstick Men and Joo, Bargains At Binsley's, Day Is Done, Gone The Sun, Stinkin' Rudy, Inside Out, and Dooka Dee.  Whether physical or mental afflictions are involved, or education level, doctorate or drop out, city folk or country folk, no one escapes Massie's imagination.<br /><br />My only problem with this collection is that it is a spendy edition that seems to have been poorly edited.  There are spelling and grammatical errors that are too obvious not to notice, but the artwork inside by Cortney Skinner makes up for the errors.  All in all, a noteworthy collection of both short and flash fiction that any horror lover should appreciate.  Enjoy!",5.0,Books,1,7

"A great start.: Project Pandora is a thrilling adventure full of intriguing characters and a fascinating world that is expertly crafted.<br /><br />I will be the first to admit that I requested this book on NetGalley because of its cover. (It’s absolutely stunning.) I didn’t know what I was getting into, and I think it works better to go into this book as blind as possible. The action kicks off from the very first page; wasting no time taking our characters into this mysterious and deadly world. It’s crazy as all heck and will surely throw readers, but as you continue reading and the mystery is slowly revealed, it becomes hard to put down.<br /><br />I liked the idea of teenage assassins who were a part of a mysterious program, never truly aware of who or what they were. It’s an intriguing premise, one that isn’t easy to pull off, as it’s important to maintain the same level of suspense throughout, and yet, Aden Polydoros managed to do just that.<br /><br />The varying points of view help to keep the book exciting, as we shift between these various characters and truly dive into their desires, their faults, and their strengths. However, the most interesting character was easily Hades who had the best arc throughout the story, compared to someone like Elizabeth, who admittedly had the weakest storyline of the bunch.<br /><br />That doesn’t mean the book is without its flaws, though. As strong as the book is, it still manages to lose steam near the end. Some things felt repetitive and the action was mainly “off screen,” whereas the author had done such a great job of highlighting the action throughout the rest of the book. It’s because of this that I had to give the book four stars as opposed to five stars. The ending just fell flat, which was unfortunate. I do still plan to read the rest of the series, though.<br /><br />One final note: I did like the use of the Greek codenames, however, it did seem weird to use Apollo and Artemis as the code names for a duo in the book given there’s a romantic aspect to the characters in this story.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"I Love This Second Chance Romance!: I absolutely adored &#34;The Evolution of Us&#34; by D. Kelly, a romance novel. The characters are wonderful and have so much depth that it became easy for me to get invested in this book. The story is about a girl named named Holly and a guy named Declan who have been best friends since they were old enough to start high school. They were next door neighbors who quickly started to develop romantic feelings for one another, and started going on double dates with their other two best friends, Sage and Baxter. When the book begins though Holly and Declan are no longer a couple, and they are now 25 years old. It's been two years since their break-up and Declan desperately wants to get back together with Holly, but Holly is just too hurt to trust Declan. She is still very attracted to him but she would never admit that to Declan. Sage and Baxter are now stuck in the middle, Sage taking Holly's side and Baxter taking Declan's. Will Holly and Declan ever find a way to get past the hurt and secrets, and get back into each other's arms?<br /><br />D. Kelly has written such a unique story. It is written with jumps from present to past then back to present, and told in either Holly's or Declan's point of view. The story had me happy one minute, hot and bothered the next, crying the next, laughing the next, and then doing it all over again; it was amazing!

Blacks started producing their own films, and building their own studios and showing them to the Black Community, a lot of these Independent Studios did a great job, some of the sound and picture may not be Hollywood quality, but their still watchable and worth a watch.

"A compilation of Shaumyan's best: Alexander Shaumyan's trademark is wry or self-effacing humor, heart rending psalms of loneliness and love, and cynical commentaries on modern times. Each of his four books is different, however, and Spirit of Rebellion is exceptional for the addition of prose. The stream of consciousness prose in ""It was a Long and Lonely Night"" was first rate. But as always, it is his deeply felt poetry that shines.<br /><br />""Just Once"" expresses Shaumyan's deep loneliness:<br /><br />Just once I want to feel free from this depression,<br /><br />Just once.......<br /><br />O to feel the sadness of the naked Moon,<br /><br />to touch the needles of despair, to hug the stones of pain.<br /><br />Tonight dress me in black velvet and hang me upon a<br /><br />cross.<br /><br />In ""O God, I Could Never Create"" he cries out for an Earth and a humanity he longs to rescue:<br /><br />But I can kiss the Earth, breathing Love into<br /><br />this once infertile soil,<br /><br />And I can make this paper into music,<br /><br />""To a Poet Who Looks for Dinosaurs in His Toilet Bowl"" mixes Shaumyan's bizarre humor with the poet's hope:<br /><br />.....that verbal acrobat playing<br /><br />with images and words<br /><br />that spread a magic veil<br /><br />over the world of anguish,<br /><br />loneliness and despair --<br /><br />He rails hopelessly against the world's ugliness and sorrow in ""Some Thoughts on War and Human Ugliness"":<br /><br />I'm not in my right mind and<br /><br />I cannot write poetry amidst it all --<br /><br />as if something inside me has been<br /><br />cut --<br /><br />As always, he dreams of desire, love and hope, but tempers these thoughts with harsh realism, as in ""With Years"":<br /><br />With years your drive goes down<br /><br />And your soul<br /><br />Becomes accustomed to the daily grind --<br /><br />With years you, too, become a local clown<br /><br />Indifferent to everything and blind.<br /><br />Alexander Shaumyan is a prolific poet who writes in a wide range of styles on a multitude of subjects. His work is well worth contemplating.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Irrelevant to much of U.S.: This is a lovely book visually, and quite dense with information for its small size. However, it's just about useless if you live in the U.S., except maybe the South and California. The author's recommendation of plants and her calendar made me start laughing. She's clearly never experienced routine humongous snowfall or temperatures routinely below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Gardening books need to have some awareness of planting zones, or it should be clear that almost nothing will apply to where you live. The takeaway: you should spend 5 minutes every day working on your garden. That's EVERY day, so ignore the fact that you'll be freezing your ass off for at least 3 months of that, if you live in Chicago (as I do) or parts north. Full disclosure: I haven't read it cover to cover yet--just browsed and dipped--but what I read made me think there's no rush. An entertaining fantasy, perhaps, for over the winter.",2.0,Books,0,7

"Brain-Twisting Noir: The phrase ""dream-like"" is overused with psychological-suspense movies, but it's more appropriate here than any other movie I can think of.  Mix one part Dark City with one part Road to Perdition, and you have a mixture of the strange, looping story that is Nobody.<br /><br />The story is a collection of a few scenes told over and over, each time through a different lens, concluding with possibly the most creative ""Whodunnit?"" surprise ending I've ever seen.<br /><br />To get into almost any detail on this movie would be to give away too much; suffice it to say that if you enjoy being puzzled and challenged, and you like your noir as black as coal, this movie's a safe bet.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

He tears up toys so quickly that I usually don't even buy him anything with strings or stuffing because it's in the trash in less than two days. This toy is different. First off, it is quite large - so if you have a really small pup I wouldn't think this is for you. The length of the rope isn't what makes it large in my opinion - it's the circumference of the rope. However, I prefer it because there is more for my dog to hold onto without accidentally slipping and grazing my hand with his razor teeth.

"My skin is so very happy!!! Highly Recommended!: I have been looking for an alternative to dryer sheets and fabric softeners. My skin is sensitive, because of eczema and acne, as well as my daughter's skin being prone to rashes due to allergies. I have found that the less chemically scented products I use to do laundry, the better. I had been about to purchase another box of dryer sheets when I ordered these up instead. I had purchased scent free dryer sheets in the past in bulk, and have run out, and haven't had anything to use. These came, and they were WAY bigger than I thought they would be. This is NOT a bad thing! In fact, I think they are less likely to disappear in the clothes since they are much bigger than those I have seen previously. They came in a nifty canvas tie string bag with a little bath wash cloth. These measure approx. 3 inches, made of wool, and are a little bit squishy. I put all 6 of them in my laundry when I started the drying process the other day. I know this says that it can decrease the drying time, which I actually did not notice to be the case, my first load took approx. 50 minutes to dry. This is about normal, so I didn't notice any difference there. (I didn't time any of my other loads, but they did not seem to be any shorter of dry time. This I am perfectly fine with.) I used Sandalwood essential oil, just a drop or two on each of the 6 balls, and I have now run maybe 10 loads through the dryer and the scent of the Sandalwood is still there, and my laundry all smells lovely. And soft. I am so very happy to not have to spend money on dryer sheets ever again. Now if they could just come up with a washer product so I never have to buy laundry soap again......<br /><br />I received this product with a promotional discount for my honest and unbiased review and these are 100% my own opinions.",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"I wouldn't buy it again: I wouldn't buy it again.  Somehow the adjustable portion was glued? or a tack weld? so I had to use 2 pairs of pliers and twist them apart.  I tried to wrap the kickstand in a towel so I wouldn't mark it up with the teeth on the pliers. But I couldn't get a good enough grip and had to use the pliers in direct contact with the kickstand, which left marks and scratched them up.  A better technician could probably get it done without the scratches.  But I couldn't.  The screws are definitely short so I had to mount it way back on the frame to have it fit my Specialized large frame with 26&#34; tires.  I also have to adjust the kickstand to the maximum length .  At this extended length and mounted so far to the back of the bike, it sticks out past the frame and looks a little goofy.  It doesn't stick out a ridiculous amount like past the tire.  But, it just doesn't look like it belongs there.  And finally, I cant just put it in the down position and lean my bike over because it's not strong enough to hold up my bike. If I take a minute and find the balance point, it can then support my bike.  But any bump or wagging dog tail could knock it over without too much difficulty.  I would return it but it was only $9 and I have kids.  So I didn't expect too much and it will probably work on one of the kid's bikes if nothing else.  To recap, as I said at the beginning, I wouldn't purchase the kickstand again.  In the end it does work. But only as well as you should expect a cheap and flimsy product to work.  And that's my honest review :)  I did not receive any discount or any other form of compensation for this review.  I'm leaving the review because I rely on reviews from others when I make my decision to purchase online and I want to help others do the same.",2.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,0,28

"Disappointed to say the least: - The front seat hardware cracked first time we took it off (see pic)<br />-  Instead of returning the whole stroller, We asked Joovy to send a FULL front seat replacement but every replacement they sent (4x!) was not the correct product even though I sent pictures EACH time of what was needed. And it was the same customer service rep each time. So far they’ve sent 3 seats/covers with no hardware and 1 rear seat (which is NOT compatible with the front seat).<br />- At this point, I fairly asked for a manager to contact me to help expedite getting the right item since it’s been TWO months still not getting the right item.<br />- 3 days still no response from a manager. What manager doesn’t quickly respond to make things right after your team screws up 4x and still hasn’t provided the correct item?<br />- I write a lengthy review on their website. Just received en email that they won’t be publishing it. There was no profanity in the review, no specific names; just details on what happened (or didn’t happen) the last 2 months with my order.<br />- I actually liked the product enough obviously to hang in there for 2 months to get a complete functional product. I guess they’re hoping I just give up and let it go or return the stroller.<br />- Don’t get the cup holder. It’s not sturdy enough attached to the stroller.<br />- If you’re using the infant car seat in the front of the stroller, you can’t really buckle your toddler into the bench. The seat belt needs to be attached to the back of the front seat. I looped the seat belt to the bench but it’s not really secure. But there’s no instructions to installing the seat belt to the bench when an infant car seat is in the front; so I guess it’s not really meant to be there (even though they told me you can seat belt your toddler to the bench without having to have use the back of the front seat).<br />- $800+ spent and 2 months later, still no complete product, no further response and a deleted review.

"Not exactly what I was hoping for: I really enjoyed the first two books of this series enough so that I reread them several times while I eagerly awaited this book.  That being said this book is a disappointment in many ways.  The reason for my 4 star rating is twofold; so others are not turned off to the first two books and I have high hopes that the author will redeem this lack luster performance in the next novel (even Robert Jordan's WoT had a few flops).<br />SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD<br />Let's start with the good. The prose is good and while there are plenty of editing issues (some more glaring than others) none were enough to make any of the passages confusing or disrupt the flow of reading.  We get to see the wedding which I enjoyed despite it being a bit abrupt and we get to enjoy some more small time adventure with our heroes. There are also some new secondary characters that join Ott's party that have real potential.<br />Now for the not so good:<br />My first issue was the lack of growth in any of the characters; even the new ones that get some page time are total enigmas (outside of basic introduction) that hint at having depth but are never explored, nor are we given any clue about how or why they might be a help to Ott and co. in future (until the last few pages but even then it is bereft of detail).  But even worse than that Ott and Raven remain portrayed as blushing pre-teens that have not even figured out what one is supposed to do with a member of the opposite sex behind closed doors. While this was acceptable in the first two books as they focused on Ott's training and others training/power accrual/party building type events.  Not that I am a fan of romance scenes but if one is going to spend that much time mentioning a particular relationship in a book then it should at least contrive to be marginally believable.  This book had very little of that, so while I did enjoy the wedding scene I had really hoped that the author would have allowed them to mature and develop into young adults and explore the growth of the relationship so one does not need to be told how they feel you just understand.<br />The next issue that this book has is that the first 75 percent of it is composed of trudging minutia, during which the only two exciting things that happen are the wedding and that Raven wins a knife skills competition, unfortunately even that is a little anticlimactic.  There is no new spell work; no time spent honing Ott and Raven's ability to cast magic as a team, no time devoted to the learning of combat skills despite that they are trying to get back to the kingdom in order to go to war. In fact there is only one instance in the entire book that Ott spars or thinks of kicking the rust off of his combat skills and for that he uses his staff?!? What happened to &#34;the finisher&#34; that was made such a big deal out of in the first book and was not mentioned once in this book he didn't even practice with a sword in this one?<br />Last but not least is the ending. First it is a cliffhanger; I can't tell you how much I hate cliffhanger endings.  Also at the end of the book our heroes (the ones we are led to believe are the strongest mages to be seen in hundreds of years) are over powered so quickly and easily without even putting up a fight that it is going to take an artifact of Deus ex machina or eucatastrophe to get Ott out of his captors hands, and with things left the way they are, there are only two very unsavory options about the fate of our other protagonists; they somehow managed to teleport away/escape and left Ott for dead or  to fend off or be captured by this uber powerful new villain or that they are all dead neither of which I like very much... and neither bode well for the continuation of this story.<br />IN SUMMARY:<br />This book felt like it should have been compressed into a 150 page novella to tide us over until the next real installment of the story arc. If I knew this one was going to end the way it did I would have shelved it until the next installment was published and read them in tandem.  Assuming the next book is up to the standards of the first two this would be the preferred way to read this series IMO.  Don't get me wrong despite my complaints this book was not bad just frustrating.<br />To the author:<br />I am under no delusions about how hard it is to not only write a novel let alone a series of novels but also how hard it is to put an intimate creative piece of yourself on display for others enjoyment in the hope that we your readers will ultimately feel satisfied and entertained. It is very easy for people like me to play &#34;back seat driver&#34; to your endeavors after the fact. Don't be discouraged and thank you for your effort I look forward to the next book.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"""Heir to the Blood Lust"": ""Heir to the Blood Lust""<br /><br />Horror master George Romero's 1976 film MARTIN is one of those studies in ambiguity where the edges of reality get pretty fuzzy.  John Amplas delivers an engaging and affecting performance as the titular character, a young man who believes himself to be the victim of a family curse in which one member is every so often born as Nosferatu (i.e., a vampire).  Romero's script, however, abandons traditional vampire lore--Martin isn't bothered too much by sunlight or Christian crosses, he eats garlic, and instead of fangs, he uses razor blades to access the precious crimson fluid of his victims.  So is Martin actually a vampire, or just a severely  disturbed young man?  What, really, is the distinction?  After all, he IS killing people and he IS drinking his victims' blood--so what if he doesn't have fangs?  And his elderly cousin, steeped in the ways of the old country, definitely believes, and HE is determined to save Martin's soul or else destroy him.<br /><br />Films like this don't come along too often, and they rarely come out of Hollywood.  Produced a few years before DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978), the first sequel to his magnum opus NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968), MARTIN is one of Romero's more thoughtful and thought-provoking works.  Characters stripped of cinematic romanticism, gritty on-location shooting in Pennsylvania suburbs, and brilliant use of grainy black-and-white footage for flashback sequences--actually, are they flashbacks, or has Martin blurred reality with sequences from his favorite films?--help to create a moving and realistic portrait of a young man who, in spite of his murderous habit, is both sympathetic and genuine.<br /><br />The influence of this film on later indie filmmakers is obvious, most notably on the relative newbie Larry Fessenden.  Indeed, Fessenden's 1997 work HABIT would make a nice companion piece--or perhaps the second of a double feature--for Romero's MARTIN, as both offer a slice from the life of a bloodsucker without making it really clear whether or not the preternatural is involved.  In actuality, the two films differ in point of view only.  MARTIN tells the story basically through the vampire's eyes; HABIT has viewers following things from the victim's standpoint.<br /><br />Lionsgate's new DVD edition of MARTIN offers a crisp transfer of the film in its original aspect ratio (anamorphically enhanced for 16:9 TVs).  In addition to the trailers and TV spots, bonus material includes both a featurette with filmmaker interviews and a feature commentary from Romero, FX man Tom Savini, and others.  Well worth the price of admission.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Great Screens At Great Prices!: I ordered one 8' X 20' screen and two 8' X 10' screens, used as sun screens for my motorhome, which were received in a timely manner and in a quality shipping container.  I have had them about 3 weeks.  I ordered, from another vendor, a box of 50 Bungee Balls and the hook and slide attachments for the screen to fit into the canopy trac. I used the Bungee Balls attachments to connect the 2 screens to my motorhome canopy arms at each end. There are grommets (about a foot apart) on all four sides of the screens, which is wonderful. The long screen was placed into the canopy front in a multi track fixture that I had previously purchased to hold a string of lights with a second track for a screen or other canopy attachment. I purchased, again, from another vendor, the attachments with hooks that slide into the track and hold with screen in place.  I leave the long front screen in place all the time.  I slide the smaller screens at each end, back like a drape, when they are not needed to block the sun and to allow access to the motorhome patio.  The screens are wonderful sun screens and when rain is a threat or the bright Florida sun is baking down,  I put the ends back down into place.  I bungee the front screen to the side screens and it encloses the entire patio, like one big room.  While not all rain/spray back is deflected, the screens do block a lot of it and the patio is dryer.  I do use a few tent stakes, at each end of the canopy to hold the screens bottom edges in place at ground level. The one big screen arrived with a small screen repair near one of the sides, but it was not blatant or unsightly.  When detected, I had done all the work to get it in place and I was not about to take it down and return it.  Had it been a large or an overt unsightly flaw, I would have.  I did notify the seller but never received a response.  Having said all that, these screens work perfectly and you cannot beat the price when comparing them to the those sold by camping/motorhome stores.",4.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"Nice christmas storage bags: The large bag is like a huge duffle bag, with a tabbed full-length zipper, two mid-placed side handles, and an additional handle on one end (a handle on both ends would have been nice so that two people could carry it). I am going to use this to store parts of my artificial Christmas Tree, replacing the bubble wrap it is currently in. The smaller bag is a cylinder and does not have handles. The zipper only opens about 1/3 of the top of the bag, so I'm not sure how useful it will be. Both bags are shapeless, with no internal support so they would not be suitable for protecting fragile items unless they were packaged safely before being placed in the bags.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Awesome sink...but not without faults (pictures): This review is for Kraus dual mount 50/50 black sink. The size of the sink is standard and I found the depth to be more than adequate. We installed this undetmount and it looks fantastic. If you are looking for a modern sink this is the one for you. Keep in mind that this sink is DUAL mount meaning you can mount it under mount or drop in. So the choice is yours. They have a single mount option as well that is cheaper. So if you already know which way you are going to mount it you might want to save some money and buy the single mount option.<br /><br />This sink has a total of 5 cutout options for your faucet (3) and other accessories (2) like a water filter and soap dispenser. You can choose to cut these out or leave them in.<br /><br />As modern and good looking that this sink is I did run into a major issue with it...keeping it clean. It does not clean like most sinks and simply wiping it with soap or water will not make it back to normal. See pictures for what the sink looks like after attempting to clean I was obviously upset about this issue and did some research and found that if you use &#34;dawn&#34; brand soap it help with the dusty aftereffect. It has to be dawn due to the specific formula they use. I used it and found that it did help. Overall the sink gets one star reduced because of the specifics of cleaning. It is not like the sinks you're used to. No pain no gain right? Beauty takes work.<br /><br />Overall I have been happy with the sink minus the cleaning issue. If I had the choice I would purchase again because it looks solo good. Enjoy.<br /><br />Oh and I would recommend a faucet with a long spout so that you're not forced to fill pots, cups, etc near the sides and can be more towards the middle of the sink basin.",4.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

they have been well covered in other reviews and are easily found on the Internet: I won't go into the benefits of Maca in this review; they have been well covered in other reviews and are easily found on the Internet. I have been taking 1/4 tsp/day for about a week and have noticed a modest increase in my energy level and libido. I expect increasing results over the next few weeks. The taste takes a little getting used to but it isn't really bad; to me it tastes a little like malt. I usually mix it with orange juice or almond milk and it is actually not unpleasant at all. The bulk powders are not only cheaper but I find the powder more convenient to take - no giant capsules or pills and the dosage is easily adjustable. I also use Bulksupplements L-Citruline and will probably purchase other bulk supplements from this company. I highly recommend them!,5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Not a good book.: When I first looked at this book I was purchasing it for a class. I saw that about half of the people rated as 5 stars which is about 50%""ish"" of the total ratings. It seems like a lot of books on the topic of LA get tough reviews so I didn't consider purchasing supplemental study material like I do for most other classes. After studying this book and figuring out how much I hate it, I started trying and figure out why so many people like this book. I discovered that 3 people were actually rating the seller, not the text itself.<br /><br />So here is what I don't like about this book.<br />  There is a proof is section 3.2 for a vector subspace of polynomials. Using their same logic for their proof on showing the defined problem was not a subspace, you could also disprove everything they claimed to be a subspace. The author also defines problem using fictional methods of addition and multiplication for the sake of a proof which doesn't help me understand the topic. It's hard to explain, but there is a lot of irrelevant examples. This isn't actually in the book but I feel like a lot of the examples are posed in the context if ""If 2 + 2 = 5"" .... Well 2+2 is never = to 5 so why are we even discussing it to show how something fails under given properties. I feel like the proofs fail during the initial statement therefore it was point to begin with. There are several examples where you see stuff like A = s[a+b], T(A) = [sa+b]. Again, this is not possible so why are we discussing this as a proof? I just can't find the logic in this book.<br /><br />  If you have a choice, I would recommend Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-Edition by David Lay. It still has a lot of the mathematic rigor. The book was also written with in the last decade so it familiar when you are reading it. The big thing that I like he shows you how linear algebra is applicable. I can now balance a chemical equation using Gauss-Jordan row reduction which makes total sense.",1.0,Books,0,7

And calling someone a stupid git, seems wrong for the setting. Now to the cats. The main character was a love them and leave them kind of guy.  I would have enjoyed reading about his checking up on the ones from the boat, or asking his landlords, who he fixed a house for,  about taking in the stray who kept him company all summer.

"A Good Family Film With a Positive Message: Based on the novel by Luanne Rice, this positive family film deals with some hard issues: abortion, childhood disability, single parenting, grieving the death of a spouse and father, domestic violence, and substance abuse. That doesn't sound like a great mix for family entertainment, but although realistic, it is tastefully done. It is also is completely clean without swearing and doesn't dwell on the unhappy scenes. It has some good messages with a happy ending, and all the loose ends are nicely resolved. Probably the main theme of the story is the value of human life, but also that when you truly love someone you are willing to give of yourself.<br />Dianne Parker (Kimberly Williams) and Mark McCune (Eric Close) marry and are expecting their first child. When they find out that their unborn child will be severely disabled, Mark urges Dianne to have an abortion. She refuses and Mark abandons the family leaving her to be a single parent. Mark's brother, David (Campbell Scott), is a friend of Dianne's who has been secretly in love with her since before she was married to his brother. He is conveniently a pediatrician and is a great help to Dianne. Worried for Dianne's heath because she is overworking herself, he arranges for Amy (Alexa Vega) to work as a mother's helper over the summer. Amy has a very bad home situation and her mother is an alcoholic. Amy develops a strong friendship with Julia, Dianne's daughter, to the point where they can almost read each other's minds.<br />This movie has superb acting by all the cast, especially young Alexa Vega and Kimberly Williams. Alexa really steals the show! I also noticed that twin girls (Amanda & Caitlin Fein) play the part of Julia. If they are not disabled (and even if they are) they did some pretty good acting. The most disturbing scenes are those that involve Amy's mother's abusive boyfriend, especially the one in which he tries to kill Amy's puppy. It all turns out okay, but parents should be warned that it is pretty frightening. It is also disturbing when Julia has seizures and children may need some explanation before viewing the film.  Amy's mother gets help and we realize by the end that Amy and her mother will have a good future together.<br />A strong message in the film is the fact that although Julia's life will be cut short because of her serious medical condition, the 6 years that she has lived are not wasted, that both she and her mother have been changed as the result of her life.<br />I would strongly recommend this movie, but better get out the Kleenexes before the climax! Oh, and the ending is just so cute.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Waste of Money: I bought this product so I could charge my Galaxy S10+ and my watch Samsung Galaxy 44mm watch at the same time.  I can't use it for my watch because the watch gets so hot that you can barely touch it to take it off.  The watch even shows a warning display after only a few minutes of being on the charger.  As for the phone, it charges it but it's as slow as molasses to charge AND the ENTIRE time it's on the charger it CONSTANTLY disconnects and reconnects (with and without the case on it) and is CONSTANTLY beeping because of the connection going in and out .  I ended up removing the cord and just plugging my phone into my computer and it charges the right way very quickly.  I don't even use the dock anymore.  This was definitely a WASTE of almost $50.  I DO NOT recommend this product.  I do have to say though that when I first got it and I complained about the charger heating my watch, the seller was very quick to respond and try to solve the problem but there is no way to solve this problem without just giving the charger back and getting a refund but, they don't do returns and refunds so this was, without a doubt, LITERALLY a waste of money.",2.0,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0,9

"another delicious album from SOS: For those of you who don't know, SOS have been writing perfect pop songs and putting out perfect pop albums for, well, close to 20 years now.<br /><br />Who knew??<br /><br />Remember 'Breakout' from 1987- the only one of their singles that still gets played on commercial radio these days?? Everyone loved that song and its message- I loved Corinne's goofy running through the park, the armfuls of bangles, the big rolls of fabric, the silly bit where the guys come in singing on different angles to Corinne- ahh, the mid-80's- I remember it all as if it were yesterday. Unlike a lot of people I went out and bought the album 'It's better to travel', fell in love with SOS and have been a big fan ever since. Their music has been with me through my teens, my 20's and now well into my 30's!!<br /><br />The one thing I really love about SOS is that they have always proudly displayed and have been true to their influences- you can hear them on this album, indeed any of their albums- Motown, Bacharach, Sergio Mendes, The Mama's and ther Papa's etc. They were there right from the start and perhaps that's why commercial raidio lost interest in them after the first album- they were looking back at a time in pop music when it wasn't fashionable to do so. I like to think they were ahead of everyone else- for me their music looked ahead to the huge nostalgia boom in the mid-90's. (Bacharach and Elvis Costello- who would ever have dreamed up that combination??) But regardless of the trends in pop music, SOS have always turned out beautifully crafted pop songs and their albums have been remarkably consistent over the years. They're huge in Japan- and have been for years but for a while there we fans could only get new albums imported from Japan. (expensive!!) But a change of label in 2001 remedied that- firstly we had the brilliant 'Somewhere deep in the night' and now we have the even more brilliant 'Where our love grows'.<br /><br />I got hold of this album 2 weeks ago- and it's been in my CD player ever since. If anything, the album bears some comparison to 'Kaleidoscope World' in its evocations of the late '60's, both in its sound and its layout (instrumentals, vocal tracks w/out instrumentals etc) but there is a very natural progression of moods and the album feels very unified- almost as if it were one great big track, so to speak.<br /><br />'Where our love grows' includes some of the catchiest songs I've ever heard from SOS. The title track is a killer, the sort of song that takes your breath away- a perfect pop song if ever there was one. 'Love won't let you down' has a great brass arrangement and a vocal hook that draws you in straight away. 'From my window' showcases Corinne's fabulous voice and all the colours in it- from the husky opening to the soaring lines in the chorus- this track is a winner. 'Let the stars shine' is so feel-good it almost hurts- note the Sergio Mendes/Brazil 66 sound- right down to the 'twang' in Corinne's vocals. Latin colour gets into a couple of instrumentals as well- esp 'Certain shades of limelight', and 'Caipirinha' which I've found is almost impossible to get out of your head!!<br /><br />All up this is one of SOS's best albums- light and breezy, summery, melodic but also highly accomplished on many levels. I love it. Buy it and tell your friends!!",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

Meaning, this is the kind of story that could happen in our society and not just in some fairy tale!

Everything was cohesive and relevant keeping up with the main story of uncovering the past to better the future. The characters were great and developed throughout the story with intrigue. I love how the characters in In All My Wishes resurfaced as secondary characters!<br />One of my favorite parts about reading is learning where the title comes from.

"except canon's service is the worst ever. I bought a new wireless router: I would have given this 4 stars, except canon's service is the worst ever.  I bought a new wireless router, and didn't remember the pin I set when I bought this printer (from bestbuy).  I called canon tech support explained the exact problem, then they proceeded to tell me to select the very menu options that were locked out because I didn't have the PIN.  When I asked how to factory reset they said they &#34;Can't&#34; tell me without proof of purchase.  They said the only acceptable proof of purchase would be a fax of the original receipt.  They wouldn't even accept an email receipt without supervisor approval, and the supervisor wasn't there.  He would call me back within 12 hours, which sounds great until you realize I called at 630 at night, so they were offering to wake me up in the middle of the night.  I don't even have a fax machine, or a landline anymore, and they were rude about the fact that I was an individual instead of a business. The other annoying thing about this printer is the lack of linux support.  When you go to the canon website there is a drop down for linux drivers, but then it just says there aren't any. Canon does not want your money, give it to brother instead.",1.0,Office_Products,0,24

"Clone of the Apple adapter, worked fine for me: I have this exact cable made by Apple, they even try to replicate the Apple packaging, without trying to mislead you into thinking it's the real thing. I am ok with companies doing this, the problem is when they try to pass it off as the real thing and sell it for close to the Apple sale price, which for this adapter is 60 dollars, 3 times the price of this one.<br /><br />The only 2 things that matter with this are if it works and if it's reliable. I can confirm that it works. I used this to screen share an iPad and iPhone to a TV with no issues. The charge port works so you could technically leave this connected all the time and the battery would never run out. At that point, you would probably just want to get an Apple TV, but it can be done. It didn't really get hot even after having it plugged in for a few hours. I watched an entire movie on my TV from my iPad and it worked well. Great for travelling, just bring an HDMI cable and your iPhone or iPad, most hotel TVs have an HDMI input these days.<br /><br />As for reliability, I can't tell you if it will work several years from now. The quality of the cable on this adapter is pretty good for a ""knockoff"". It has good strain reliefs and worked right away every time I plugged it in, exactly like the official Apple unit. I am going to keep using this one and keep the Apple one as a backup. I'm curious how long this one lasts. Video quality is exactly the same as the Apple adapter so no complaints from me. There is one difference with this adapter from the Apple one I should mention. You need to plug in the lightning cable to power it on. I'm not sure why, because the Apple adapter doesn't require this, but it is a third of the cost so you can decide if that is something that is going to be an issue. I always have my power cable plugged in when sharing video, otherwise the battery runs down too fast.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"Transforming the Bean Counter...: The book's presentation makes a case for accurate and timely information that is easily understood and actionable.  Whereby it is now time to take the benefits learned from implementing lean manufacturing on the shop floor into the office and remove the blinders of old traditional accounting systems.  Doing so transforms the accountant from bean counter to a valued partner in the business.<br />Discussions include:<br />* a strong section on performance measurement - what the financial team should be measuring in place of current traditional accounting reports.<br />* how to streamline the process and bring about meaningful change<br />* a practical methodology for making the transition away from cost accounting - to go from micro accounting to macro accounting<br />* plain English management financial systems - what they are, why to use, benefits, and how to get them using the one day close method<br />* new concepts in budgeting (the lean budget) and capital planning whereby one looks at reduction in inventory and flexibility instead of per part cost<br />* lean acquisitions - what to do with all that new found cash<br />The final three chapters are my favorite where Jean and Orest take their boardroom management skills and depart wisdom to the reader.  Here it is explained why the CEO and CFO must become active leaders, the benefits of breaking from tradition, and the twelve principles of lean accounting.<br />This is a must read book for everyone who wants to shed the role of bean counter or who has struggled with bean counters and their misunderstanding the accounting side of lean manufacturing.<br />Rick Anderson<br />President<br />TTW Inc. - WinMan software",5.0,Books,1,7

"Clumps hard but doesn’t help ammonia smell. Tracks a lot.: I’ve got 2 fluffy cats. While I haven’t noticed the litter sticking to their fur like a shaved pine litter did, it does track more than the Dr. Elsely’s clay scoopable. A little dust, but one of the better in that categories. As good if not better than Dr. Elsley’s with regard to dust. This litter does clump surprisingly well though! My cats are raw fed so they don’t produce as much waste as cats fed commercial canned or kibble fed cats do (big plus!!). Because of that, and I do have 2 large litter boxes, I can go 2 or 3 days even without scooping before it “must” be done. Generally I still scoop daily. I recently went on a business trip for 5 days. Came home and my 20 year old son admitted he had forgotten to scoop the boxes. Aside from being upset at him, I was surprised that the boxes weren’t that bad. The clumps were still clumps. Normally if neglected too long, clay clumping litter will become a gooey mess. Not this. There were no clumps on clumps creating super clumps of goo stuck to the sides or bottom. Not an optimal way to find out that this stuff holds up, but I’m happy that it was this product vs the other under this circumstance. I definitely notice the ammonia smell more with this than a clay litter and it tracks worse in my opinion. I do use animalEO Litteroma (essential oil blend) with baking soda, mixed in with the litter and that has helped tremendously. I’d give it 5 stars for clumping and durability but 4 because of the tracking and ammonia smell (add animalEO veterinary EOs Litteroma and the ammonia smell is no issue!!)",4.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26

"... for the past 6 months and is still in excellent condition, and I am ROUGH on phones and ...: This case has lasted and held up for the past 6 months and is still in excellent condition, and I am ROUGH on phones and cases lol I drop them a lot. My only issue, and it's a pretty irritating one, is that whenever I take pictures, regardless of whether it is front facing or normal, the case around the camera lens casts a (in my case, blue) tint around the bottom of the picture when its regular facing and top when it's front facing. Very, very annoying. Several times, I pull the entire case off to take pictures, which basically defeats the purpose of having it, especially when you're clumsy like me lol other than that, it's an excellent case, especially for the price.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"not as good as the movie: I hate to do the old book/movie comparison, but I picked up this book because I loved the movie and wanted to read the material it was based on.  I found Oliver's narration to be spot-on funny in both formats, but whereas in the movie, he comes across as an endearing, if a bit unusual, teenage boy, in the book, he borders on mean-spirited/creepy.  There were a couple of episodes that went from ""I remember what it felt like to be that age"" to ""Wait a minute, this kid needs some serious therapy.""  I also felt like the movie improved on the narrative structure by actually providing some arc/closure to the characters as opposed to just being a string of unrelated incidents.  I was surprised to see how little Graham features in the book considering that he was such a fully fleshed-out character in the movie.",2.0,Books,0,7

"A compelling premise, but the plot unravels as you go: I read &#34;Underground Airlines&#34; immediately after finishing &#34;The Underground Railroad,&#34; due to a confluence of library availability/book club scheduling. I liked both but found that each had challenges with the structure and character development that made it difficult for me to fully invest in the story. &#34;Underground Airlines&#34; is set in a fictionalized present, with cassette tapes and cars and computers and chain stores. In this alternate history, Lincoln was assassinated shortly after his election, and a Congressional compromise permanently enshrines slavery in the South. By the time the novel begins, slavery is limited to the &#34;Hard Four&#34; states that refuse to give up their free labor. The rest of the United States and its corporations make a series of compromises to deny moral culpability while allowing slavery to continue.<br /><br />In &#34;Underground Airlines,&#34; the protagonist, who goes by a shifting set of names from Jim to Victor to Brother, is an escaped slave who has been caught and is now trapped in a new form of servitude, forced by the U.S. government to track down other attempted runaways. He hates his work but feels he has no choice; if he tries to flee again, he will be returned to slavery or killed. As he is tracing the flight of a man to Indianapolis, he uncovers information through the &#34;Underground Airlines&#34; -- a network of allies helping slaves escape -- that could lead to his freedom. But his bosses at the U.S. Marshals Service also expect him to hand over the evidence.<br /><br />I admired how Winters portrayed the hypocrisy of the rest of the nation; most people would claim not to buy from companies that use slave labor, yet Atlanta allowed those corporations to use its highways to transport goods. It reminded me of the fact that most of us buy from retailers that benefit from exploitative prison labor to this day. I empathized with Victor's self-loathing for being forced to serve as an informant and badly wanted him to escape. Winters painfully describes the brutality and violence of slavery in ways that emphasize how many lives were destroyed by a cruel and unjust system -- one that was kept in place by millions of individual choices.<br /><br />Yet the plot of &#34;Underground Airlines&#34; slips from a well-paced, believable story in the North to a chaotic, underexplained cascade of events when Victor travels to the South. By the end of the novel, I found myself outside the tension of the story, disbelieving what had happened and wondering how the author would wrap up the loose ends. Some of the fantastical elements introduced in the final chapters undermined the overall cohesion of the book and distracted from the compelling psychological tension of its earlier scenes. I finished the book impressed by its ability to portray the lasting consequences of slavery and racism but unconvinced of its internal coherence.",3.0,Books,0,7

"These are the yolks, folks: You know how it is.  A wave of newly published children's books hits bookstore shelves nationwide and somehow you miss some of the lovelier offerings in the mix.  Basically, by the time you've gotten your bearings and have waded through most of what's out there, a fresh and entirely NEW crop of books fill the shelves and you're left wondering what might have eluded your grasp.  What did I personally miss?  I missed ""An Egg Is Quiet"", and I am thoroughly ashamed of the fact.  Now I have come to right a great wrong and heap healthy scads of praise on this most deserving book.  Beautiful and informative all at once, it brings scientific information to the kiddies in a form that both they and their very happy parents will appreciate.<br /><br />Before we get to the words in this book, let's just open the cover.  Ahhhh.  See that?  I'm talking about the endpapers.  They're blue and artfully speckled.  Okay, let's move on.  Turn another page and now what do you see?  Two pages of eggs suspended against a white background.  Now we enter into the book and we learn all sorts of things about these yolky wonders.  We see a massive variety in shell colors, from the magenta-tinged black-capped mockingthrush to the deep sea-blue green of the glossy ibis.  We see how eggs can be different shapes, sizes, and have variegated patterns.  They're even textured differently, and in the book we see the gooey, rubbery, hard, smooth, and rough eggs of the world.  Old dinosaur eggs and the development of embryos lead up to the final discovery.  Yes, an egg may be quiet.  But just wait until it hatches and then just listen to the noise.  The final two pages before the endpapers show all kinds of insects, birds, and other egg-hatching creatures taking a kind of final bow.<br /><br />What I respect about Dianna Aston is that she doesn't limit her scope.  It would have been the most logical thing in the world to focus this book on bird eggs and go no further.  Instead, she's not afraid of being inclusive.  The section on the shapes of eggs even shows a perfectly round sea turtle egg, next to an oval ladybird beetle, next to a pointy common murre, next to a truly disturbing can't-get-it-out-of-my-brain-no-matter-how-hard-I-try dogfish egg of the tubular persuasion.  Variety is the name of the game here and Aston has the situation truly well in hand.  She was only half the team, though.  Just as much credit, then, must be handed over to illustrator Sylvia Long.<br /><br />First of all, paint me baffled when I discovered that the only materials that went into the creation of ""An Egg Is Quiet"" were listed merely as ""ink and watercolor"".  Now, I have seen watercolors in my days.  They are sloppy and messy and they don't leave much room for the kind of elegant white space you find in this book.  Yet on closer inspection there was no denying it.  Long has mastered the art of the tiny watercolor detail.  Whether she's tracing the green sinews of the passion vine butterfly's home or embedding the tiniest of speckles on the egg of a southern cassowary, the meticulousness you find in this book only adds to its appeal.  There is a realism to these images that never becomes so scientific as to render them dull (if that makes any sense).  Best of all are the tiny labels found on each and every page that describe what it is we are seeing and that have delicious names like sooty tern, paradise riflebird, and hepatic tanager.  There are even notes that for the sake of accuracy will make it clear when, ""all eggs on this page larger than actual size.""<br /><br />Something you may have missed when you gave this book a quick once over: Remember when you opened the book and saw the two pages of eggs?  Now remember when you were at the end of the book and you saw the two pages of birds, insects, and sea critters?  Well don't look now, but a lot of those eggs and hatchlings match up.  Not all and not perfectly (unless someone can locate for me the hatched katydid) but enough that any kid who loves a little ""I Spy"" will be flipping back and forth and forth and back like there's no tomorrow.<br /><br />The trend in children's publishing right now can be summed up in a single word: Foil.  Shiny shiny foil.  Whether they're reprinting ""The Cat and the Hat"" to make it glitter or they're pushing the insidious ""Rainbow Fish"" on innocent children, foil is the new black.  What everyone should be doing, though, is taking a page out of Chronicle Books' ... uh ... book.  ""An Egg Is Quiet"" has foil on its cover, but it's supremely subtle.  The cursive letters of the title have a blue sheen with just a hint of green with the light hits them correctly.  Maybe it's silly to compliment a book on what it hasn't done rather than what it has, but when it comes to attracting the eye of glitter-happy tots, this is undoubtedly the most sublime use of sparkles I've ever seen.<br /><br />Oh, it's a joy.  A factual informative delight.  Kids will pore over it for hours and, once in bed, their parents will soon be doing the same.  If you know a kid with a scientific bent, or at the very least a healthy interest in the natural world, consider this the perfect gift.  A divine alignment of text and image.",5.0,Books,1,7

I have this running joke with my GF about my armpits and we were holidaying in Phuket last month, saw a shop selling small deodorant made of crytals for something like THB40. I thought what the heck, give it a shot. The first 3 days, it didn't do anything. Still the same old running joke about my armpits. But about 4-5 days later, I noticed I have lesser 'ammunition' to keep the joke running. Another week past and NO MORE JOKE! Went online and bought this Crystal Body Deodorant for keeps. And I'm good til now! I've used everything else before - antiperspirant roll-ons, sprays, silver-laced cream thingy, but they only last a while. But this works.

"College relationship?: I thoroughly enjoyed reading Where We Left off. Parrish wrote the book as an old-school first person novel: one character, Leo, tells the complete story. In my opinion, authors can sometimes get so carried away writing first person from several perspectives, that it becomes confusing. Although I know from personal experience that multiple first person perspectives can sometimes make telling a story easier. Anyway, this book definitely isn't a cookie-cutter M/M romance. I found it to be very satisfying!<br /><br />This book is the third in a series. It is definitely a stand alone novel, though I think having read book one of the series beforehand would add to the reading enjoyment of Off. I enjoyed the development of the main and secondary characters. I felt like Leo could easily be an actual college student in his first year at NYU. The portrayal of college life was believable and the New York City setting was perfect. The editing is spot-on.<br /><br />It is easy for me to recommend Where We Left Off to readers who enjoy this genre, and who are looking to read a well-written book!",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"Decent speaker -- Overpowering bass: I was expecting a bit more for the size and wattage of the speaker, but overall I found this speaker to be just average. The bass is a bit overpowering, even at the lowest setting, drowning out a lot of the mids and highs. At higher settings, it gets distorted and starts popping a bit. I find the sound quality is best at or around the 50% volume mark. Above that, it also gets a bit distorted. It can get very loud though. The RGB settings are pretty basic and somewhat of a novelty. It doesn't charge via USB, it has a separate power brick with a barrel style plug.

Wonderful for Small or Petite Adult Faces: I love the fact that these masks are of organic material because my skin had been acting up under other masks.

They did come with adapters for 18650 batteries (I didn't expect them to), which I was very happy with because i happened to have 4 of those. They are the same batteries for my vaping mods. I popped the 18650 batteries into the sleeves and screwed the lid back on. When i turned the first one on it was quite impressive. I was so shocked by how bright and focused they were. The zoom worked perfectly. The different modes were easy and great, especially the abillity to dim or brighten an led flashlight for different tasks. For this price i looked around and these are comparable to $60.00 single flashlights. Totally worth it, i will and have been recommending these to my friends.

"Pretty good, but a little long: I generally enjoy R.N. Patterson's stories and was thrilled to start reading this one that obviously laid out his Democrat leanings.  The story was intriguing and well connected.  It is tough to bring together so many different stories and keep it all straight, so I give him a lot of credit.  I also like the pleasant surprise of bringing in characters from other books - it makes you want to read these books to get the explanations of their pasts.  My main complaints about this book are that 1) it is a little too long and 2) some parts were kind of boring and not incredibly gripping.

"Great series as always. Never disappointed by Craven's work.: This book series is chock full of action and emotions. The characters are dynamic and interesting and the storyline is complex and constantly moving. The puppers remind me of mine and one who passed away last year- Jax a boxer and American bulldog mix. He herded the kids, wouldn't let people within ten feet of them without me allowing it, and helped train our other male pup Chibbs (doberman pit mix) to guard us and comfort our oldest son who has autism. Now we have Chibbs and Fiona (pit who is 1/2 blue and 1/2 brindle) they are both younger but they keep us all safe and help with the kids. Unless they think you are a threat to one of us or a child they are completely harmless and sweet hearts. But if they don't like the smell of you or you seem like a threat you better pray that I am there to command them to stop. Dogs are pure, love, loyalty, and pack are all they care about.

"Amazing set of buds with a quick modification.: These buds are pretty amazing but they weren't that way out of the box. The earbud tips that come with these are very unsatisfying to use and leave a lot to be desired with the sound. For me, the issue was a case of getting good coverage over my ear canal and none of the ear tips in the box worked. If only some foam tips were in the box.<br /><br />Standard foam tips don't fit inside the case on the buds. However, I was able to trim the tips to size and now they are amazing and probably my favorite set of earbuds I've owned. Foam tips make a better seal for me and feel more secure during any activity. I hope in the future Anker/Soundcore offers foam tips in the box because while the buds themselves sound great any set of buds will sound poor when they don't fit your ear well.<br /><br />The sound feels full and nothing ever feels distorted like in some buds. The inclusion of EQ settings is nice but I've had the most success with the custom EQ.<br /><br />Build quality is fantastic. The matte finish of the case is a nice touch as well as the USB C charging port. It all feels sturdy with no connection issues so far.<br /><br />HOW TO ADD FOAM TIPS: Use some very sharp precise scissors and start with small removals of foam. I was eventually able to get them to the right size where they fit into the case perfectly while on the buds. I then used a very small amount of superglue applied to the inside of the foam tip and on the outside of the earbud where the tip rests. Make sure not to cover the speaker openings.<br /><br />Voila, you now have secure foam tips for your Liberty Air 2s that in my opinion make a better seal and let the great sound of the earbuds shine through.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Opposites attract in this slow burn read: Solid 3.5 stars<br /><br />I wasn’t thrilled when I started this read, knowing that Giselle was the heroine. In the previous book, I couldn’t stand her. But, I tried to go into this read with an open mind. In the end, I came around to Giselle. The author did a great job of showing the true personality of her character and explaining exactly why G was the way she was.<br /><br />I adored Devon. Absolutely adored him. He had a painful past and was still dealing with the effects of growing up in a broken home and feeling as though everyone leaves him. He was convinced that he couldn’t let anyone too close to him because they’d eventually leave. Always the fun loving, good time guy to mask his pain.<br /><br />This opposites attract romance was entertaining in the beginning but after a while, the wishy-washy dynamic between the characters became frustrating. Neither of them knew what they wanted and when they did, they wouldn’t say anything. It was a roller coaster. I also didn’t believe anything that happened in the bedroom after the h lost her v card. She’d instantly turn into this sexual explorer and basically banged Devon everyday in all kinds of positions. Her virginity was such a major part of the story that everything felt completely unrealistic. Hot, yes. Believable, hardly.<br /><br />There was a lot going on in this novel. A ton of nerdy science jargon, sci-fi romance writing, football, small town dynamic... it was kind of all over the place!<br /><br />The HEA was lovely and I was happy with the way the author made both characters deal with their heartbreak and loneliness before throwing them back together. I was pleased that neither character had to give up their dreams so they could be together. They compromised and leaned on each other.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

He made his literary debut in l990 with a story in the prestiges Romania Literara and has been receiving rave reviews since. Considered one of the most popular playwrights of his time, Vlad Zografi's unforgettable plays have been staged around the world.

"Overall a good dry weather tent: We have used this a couple of times now in different conditions and have found that it is primarily a dry weather tent.  Technically it will keep the rain off your head, but the water will likely seep in from the bottom (which happened on camping trip #1), or condensation will build up on the inner walls, making the interior damp (camping trip #2).  It is nice and spacious, room for 2 adults or 1 adult and 2 smaller kids.  It was very easy to put up, and not difficult to take down.  We still think it was a good deal for the price, particularly now that we understand the limitations.",4.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

Secure: The profile is high enough to mount a 50mm scope.<br />Four mounting screws and built in scope stop screw insure the scope won't move under heavy recoil applications.<br />I cleaned the dovetail grooves with alcohol and set the base of these mounts then the screw stop if you have the option and then the scope with they're eight mounting screws. When sighting in a scope this mounts eliminates one factor which is scope walking on a high recoil gun.<br />After a few 3 screw  scope rail adapters I found these 4 screw rings to be more secure and affordable.<br />Works great on my break barrel air rifle.,5.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Unreliable, not to be trusted: I replaced five thermostats in my house with these units.  Occasionally, the ELV4 thermostats will not actually turn the heat on when they are supposed to, resulting in rooms getting cold.  When this happens, the display on the ELV4 indicates that the heat is on, but the heaters aren't receiving electrical power, so it appears to be a problem with the relay in the thermostat.  Adjusting the temperature down and then back up causes the relay to shut off and back on, which fixes the problem.<br /><br />ALL five of the ELV4 thermostats exhibit this issue.  New batteries make no difference.<br /><br />Luckily, my home has many heating zones so when this happens enough heat leaks from room to room and I haven't had any rooms go below freezing.<br /><br />However, if these ELV4 thermostats had been installed at a vacation cabin or shore house, the pipes surely would have frozen and burst.

I admit to reading it in a day because I simply could not put it down, I had to find out what happened next!! But I'm having a problem using the word ""excellent"" because, I hate to admit, I just dislike sad endings. I just knew the book HAD to end like that, but it was sad nonetheless. Perhaps a sequel is in order, so we can see how the twins are doing and this new race of people. And perhaps a new love interest for Keanu??

"WOW...: This is an excellent (and very easy to read) book that deals with some of the harsh realities of: marriage; having children; infidelity; broken dreams; disillusionment; being in love with someone who's in love with someone else; and the struggle to make sense out of a sometimes overwhelmingly chaotic and disappointing life.  Truly, I found it mesmerizing and almost impossible to put down.  I can understand how, according to one of the dust jacket reviews, one might want to try reading the entire thing in one sitting.  I found myself reading it for several hours at a time, well into the night, even after being exhausted from a long day at work.  The characters are very real and I found myself relating to them on many levels.  Also, the book made me more conscious of the threat we pose to our environment and I want to learn more about preserving our great outdoors - I for one love to go outside and enjoy the rivers, trees, and beaches out there and I'd hate to see them destroyed by pollution and big business.  I will say there were a few small parts in the story that I found a little disgusting (like the search for the wedding band) but I won't get into those here.  I highly recommend this book and think it will pass the test of time and become a classic.  If I were to compare it to a contemporary movie, I'd have to say it reminds me a bit of REVOLUTIONARY ROAD.  Anyway, it's also great, I think, for people dealing with their own struggle to make sense out of life.  I think it's a great story about human nature, how morality can be a huge gray area, and how one can sometimes find hope in life's simple things...",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20
"I Am Me...Album of the year!!: Ashlee Simpson is simply the best. I am 33 years old and I love Ashlee! I can tell you that I love her more than any other music artist out there. I got into Ashlee just before her Autobiography album came out. I really loved Autobiography but I Am Me shows a more mature side of Ashlee. She also addresses her infamous SNL incident on a couple of songs. Ashlee has really grown up and matured and I believe she has learned a good lesson from SNL.<br /><br />There are plenty of fun songs to go along with the serious, grown up Ashlee too. Here is my song by song review and rating of I Am Me...<br /><br />Boyfriend- 9/10- The disc's first track and first single is one of those fun songs. It's rumored to be about Lindsay Lohan (Ashlee has denied this but come on!) It's a great song to sing along to and it's a great album opener.<br /><br />In Another Life- 7/10- Her next song, In Another Life, is a song about a guy she must have had in another life. It's a cute song but clearly, not the best on the album, but still a good song.<br /><br />Beautifully Broken- 9/10- This is one of the best songs on the album in my opinion. It's one of her deeper songs about all the rough times she went through in her career so far. One of my favorite lines from this song is<br /><br />""Every day is a new day I'm reminded of my past<br /><br />Everytime theres another storm I know that it wont last<br /><br />Every moment I'm filled with hope<br /><br />cause i get another chance""<br /><br />That one and also this...<br /><br />""Without the highs and the lows<br /><br />Where will we go?""<br /><br />A great, heartfelt song.<br /><br />L.O. V.E.- 10/10- Next is another fun song and her second single L.O.V.E. To be honest, when I first heard this song I didn't really care for it. But it really has grown on me. So much so, I will say it's one of the top 3 songs on the album. Maybe #1 depending on my mood. It's not a deep song, but it's fun and catchy. The lyrics will get stuck in your head and you will be singing LO LO LO LOVE LO LO LO all the time after a few listens. Great song and awesome single.<br /><br />Coming Back For More- 8/10- The next song, Coming Back For More, is an upbeat song about a guy that she keeps thinking about. It's a good song because it's upbeat and she is obviously singing about something she knows about.<br /><br />Dancing Alone- 7/10- This one has got a good tempo. It's a real fun song. Even though there is nothing that makes this song stand out as far as lyrics I still love this song. Just the beat and tempo makes this song great!<br /><br />Burnin Up- 8/10- This is another one of those catchy, fun songs. I really like how catchy this song is. Ashlee really sounds great in this song. I don't really have any more to say about it but I think you will like it.<br /><br />Cath Me When I Fall- 9.5/10- I am really not a fan of slow songs, but Catch Me When I Fall is one of my favorite songs on this album. It deals with her infamous SNL incident. It's such an emotional, personal song for Ashlee and it makes me want to yell out to her ""I will catch you when you fall Ashlee!"" My favorite lyrics from this song is this verse here...<br /><br />It may seem I have everything<br /><br />But everything means nothing<br /><br />When the ride that you've been on<br /><br />That you're coming off<br /><br />Leaves you feeling lost<br /><br />This is one of my top 3 songs on the album.<br /><br />I Am Me- 10/10- Now, for the song that fights for my #1 favorite song with L.O.V.E., I Am Me. This is a great rocking song that proves that Ashlee is a threat to be a force in rock n roll. I think Ashlee should focus more on the rock star side of her and get away from the dance/pop type stuff. I Am Me is Ashlee at her best. It's fun, it's rocking, and it has a great message for anyone...""I am me...and I won't change for anyone"" Ashlee really has fun with this song and you will too when you listen.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Open- 9/10- Here is another unique, upbeat song that is fun to listen to. I love the part that goes ""Cool wind on my face..."" Ashlee was talking about this song at her concert I went to and she said she wrote it after she moved in to her new house. She said she was alone in a big new house and everytime she heard a noise or something it made her froze so this is the song she wrote about it.<br /><br />Say Goodbye- 8/10- This is the albums final cut. It's a slower song but it's perfect for an album closer. I really enjoy this song like I do all of Ashlee's songs. My favorite lines from this song is...<br /><br />Maybe you don't<br /><br />Love me<br /><br />Like I love you baby<br /><br />Cause the broken in you doesn't make me run<br /><br />There is beauty<br /><br />In the dark side<br /><br />I'm not frightened<br /><br />Without it I could never fel the sun<br /><br />Overall, the I Am Me album gets a 9/10.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, it's hard to say exactly what draws me, a 33 year old guy to Ashlee's music. I know her normal demographic is teenagers but I think Ashlee has a great message for people of all ages guys and girls. I think it's because, no matter how hard she falls, and how many mistakes she makes she always picks herself back up and comes back better than ever.<br /><br />Ashlee has made some mistakes, but like all of us she's human. I think it's unfair the way some people have treated Ashlee. People that still make a big deal about the SNL incident have obviously not followed what she has done since then. She has more than made up for the SNL with her tours and her other appearences she has had where she not only has proven she can sing live, but she sings live very well!<br /><br />In fact, I can honestly say, the 3 Ashlee concerts I went to were the most energetic, fun, and awesome concerts I have ever been to, and I have been to numerous concerts including many legendary rock bands. But Ashlee has so much raw energy and the crowd has almost as much energy as Ashlee does. In fact, the crowds at the Ashlee concert were the loudest, craziest, most fun crowd out of any shows I have been to.<br /><br />I highly recommend I Am Me to everyone. It's one of those rare albums that I can listen to every song and not get bored. In fact I can listen to this album over and over again and not get tired of it. I also recommend that you go see Ashlee in concert. You won't be disappointed!",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Forget this product! Make your own calibration liquid.: Be skeptical of this product. It’s not guaranteed accurate, and I would not simply rely on it.<br /><br />I thought it’d be useful to check / calibrate my Milwaukee digital refractometer with this product. I trusted this was professionally made and initially concluded my device was off by 1 ppt even after many attempts to calibrate with RODI. As a result, I started adjusting my 3 tanks to the salinity level of this product. My corals and livestock were fine, but I came across an article from reef2reef on how to make your own calibration solution. I care about precision a lot and used a higher resolution scale to weigh out salt and RODI to the hundredths in grams. I finally tested my homemade calibration liquid to find my refractometer is 100% spot on and this product off by 1 ppt. Personally that’s too much error for me. I am disappointed that this is unreliable, but glad my refractometer is reliable.<br /><br />To make your own calibration fluid: use 3.65g of table salt and 96.35 of RODI.

"Great book!: Las Palmas was an exclusive private BDSM club held on a hugh private estate.  The huge converted barn was elegant in it's decorations.  When the 3 owners of the property, Overseers,  arrived they stated that everyone had gotten complacent and they were changing it up with a game.  All the Masters and Doms would get a letter - from A to Z and they would have 30 days to complete the task with the slave or sub also assigned that letter.<br /><br />A is for Anna<br /><br />Anna was wondering what Dom would arrive for her as she knew her present Dom would be enraged to share her, but since he had not collared her she had to obey any Dom.  The Dom arrived in a suit and a fedora hat which hid his identity.  She felt something cold on her chest and was curious as to what is was since she had been commanded to close her eyes.  When she opened her eyes she saw a scarlet ""A"".  The Dom finally removed his fedora to find that Master Jansen stood before her...her Dom.  Who disguised himself well in the suit since he was always in jeans without a shirt.<br /><br />The story between Anna and Jensen took a surprising and unexpected romantic twist at the end of the book.  I totally enjoyed this book and can't wait to see what letter ""B"" has in store.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20
Easy activity with kids: Ordered these to make candles for our Chanukah menorah. Each sheet makes 2 candles (or four short ones).

He has a twin brother and another brother.  However he hardly lets them in.<br /><br />Sofia doesn't know about Raphael. She knows he wants to help but at the same time he's over bearing and very controlling.

"I decided to write smaller reviews for each of them because they were all pretty great reads: So sometime around September I found myself binge reading Lauren Blakely’s contemporaries and I never got around to fully reviewing them, I decided to write smaller reviews for each of them because they were all pretty great reads!<br /><br />From standalones Well Hung was the first book I read by Lauren Blakely and I really enjoyed this and this is what persuaded me to read the other romantic comedy books by her.<br /><br />Wyatt Hammer has a thing for his personal assistant Natalie, has had a thing for her ever since she started working for him six months ago at his construction business.  They have a wonderful work relationship, Natalie makes his life so much easier with her immaculate organizational skills and they make a great team. Wyatt doesn’t want to change anything even though he is extremely attracted to Natalie because she happens to be great at everything; she smart, funny, beautiful and a total sweetheart.<br /><br />So when a work related Vegas trips ends up with them getting drunk and waking up next morning realising they got hitched is a shock to say the least. Side Note their drunken antics were hilarious!!<br /><br />Obviously they think getting their marriage annulled is the way to go but alas they got can’t stop from wanting each other and having sex amongst other things. The only issue is Wyatt’s previous relationships hang ups and a promise which is stopping them from being with each other.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this, it has kind of the vibe of the movie what happens in Vegas but is more romantic and funny! I loved how Wyatt was a genuinely nice guy and caring/loving towards Natalie.<br /><br />All the book are written from the guys POV,  I think this one did include Natalie’s POV but mostly the book was from Wyatt’s and the heroes are all very interesting and unique so their POVs made me laugh and grin.",4.0,Books,1,7

"These were better in theory: I was excited to get these as I had been doing quite a bit of gardening now that spring has arrived.  I used them to clear a small 20 sf flower bed that had gotten overtaken with weeds to prepare the plot for planting some wildflower seeds.  It was fun for about two minutes pretending to be a clawed superhero, then it got tedious, then it starts to hurt the fingers.  It is also hard to grip anything securely with these on, so you need to pull them off if say you need to use the shears or a shovel for a bit.<br /><br />I found the normal nitrile coated gardening gloves without tips more practical.  These get stars only for the novelty of the concept.",3.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

"Another top notch printer from Flsun, Thank you Flsun!: This is my second Flsun printer and is the big brother to my other printer.  As always, Flsun is top notch!  From the parts to customer service, everything is always right on the money.<br /><br />This is another highly up-gradable printer and I am looking forward to putting my finishing touches on it.  I used my original Flsun i3 to make custom parts for this printer and it has turned out incredibly well.  It is easy to upgrade, prints really smooth and accurate.  The touch screen is an added bonus and looks really nice.  The power supply is more than adequate, especially when adding a mosfet to the build for the heated bed and the hot end.  Accurate and consistent temps, quick heat up with the added mosfet's.  From packaging of the parts to the final product, this is a great large scale printer for the money.  Comparatively a similar printer (and I mean basically the exact same printer just with a different name) costs over $700.  Joseph at Flsun is always very helpful, he often checks on me to make sure everything is working well.  That is a nice thing to do and shows the level of commitment that Flsun provides to their customers.<br /><br />NOTE regarding reviews: One thing that I have learned from my experiences with 3D Printers and research of the same, is that people complain or rate lower, the printers they purchase because it takes them a while to build or have difficulty understanding what they are doing.  Having read many reviews, it has become very obvious that some people really don't know what they are doing and I believe that this is due to a lack of pre-education about the printers and processes.  Please, for every customer's sake, DON&#34;T BLAME THE PRINTER OR PARTS for your own ineptitude (and I do not mean this in a negative way).  There is plenty of help as are resources available to you and all you have to do is look.  If you don't take the time to educate yourself before attempting to build a 3D printer, then that is entirely on you and not the product.  Building these printers, regardless of brand, takes time and patience.  To fine tune the printer also takes time, patience, experience and a whole lot reading.  It also requires you to make mistakes and understand what the mistake is.  So please be patient and look for the resources or look for help.  As far as Flsun goes, just reach out too them and they will be more than happy to help you as they really do appreciate their customers.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Keeps up to 15"" laptops elevated (and provides extra space) when using a wireless keyboard and mouse: I have limited space on my breakfast nook and for the few times I work from home, I needed an option that would provide me with extra space so that I could add on a wireless keyboard and mouse and extra monitor without making it impossible to move.  This loft did the trick because it sturdily elevated my 15&#34; work laptop, allowing me space underneath to store the wireless keyboard/mouse combo when not in use.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br />- This is designed for most 11 – 15 inch laptops. I do wish, however, it held larger laptops.<br />- It has a rubberized strip on both the bottom and top of the loft so that there's no slippage on the table or with the laptop.<br />- It is also easy to assemble by inserting the center clip and sliding each piece of the platform into the channel on the clip.<br />- It is also easy to disassemble. In fact, I consider it a bit too easy to disassemble. Since the top part of the loft comes off the moment it is handled, I do not recommend moving the loft with the laptop resting on top.<br /><br />I tried this with the following three laptops:<br />- 15&#34; Dell Latitude E6430 (my work laptop)<br />- 17&#34; Dell Inspiron 1720 (not recommended, it was a bit too heavy for this laptop)<br />- 15.6&#34; HP Omen Laptop<br /><br />According to the box, there's a 2-year limited warranty on this stand.<br /><br />In general, I love this loft. It works perfectly for my 15&#34; work laptop which is what I got it for. Although I wish it did not come apart so easily, it remains sturdy when the laptop is resting on top and the easy dis-assembly is the price you pay for the ability to swiftly break this down for storage.<br /><br />I attached a picture of this stand in use with my work laptop with the wireless keyboard and mouse attached.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Design flaw?: Having just set this mouse up about an hour ago, I am going to allow myself more time to adapt to its ergonomics.  My initial impression is that small mouse movements are a) either less precise than the traditional mouse or b) take longer, depending on the mouse speed you select. Continued adjusting of the mouse speed and acceleration settings will either confirm or refute that observation.<br /><br />I like the fact my hand naturally rests more vertically, which should put less pressure on the wrist. However, due to the angle of the mouse, my wrist flexes significantly while using it, which puts additional pressure on the wrist.  So I have ordered a pad to use for the wrist and will make a decision as to its usability for me after trying it out with the Logitech. However, the auxillary buttons which sit on the top edge of the main buttons, are awkward at best to click.  A  more natural position, in my opinion, would have been to put them on the lower edge of the main buttons.<br /><br />Ergonomics aside, a possible design flaw related to the scrolling function has me leaning towards a return of this mouse.  When opening a window within a window (for example when clicking on an Amazon.com review) the scroll wheel will not activate the inset area. Instead, scrolling only controls the main browser window.  I have to mouse over the scroll bar in the inset area and manually scroll down.  I noticed the same thing when checking my e-mail. Several folders sit on the left hand side of the pane in their own scrolling area.  With a traditional mouse, I would left click somewhere inside the pain and use the scroll button to move up and down. But navigating up and down the pane with the Trackman is not just a pain, it's impossible.",2.0,Electronics,0,12

"Hoped It Would Be Better - Not Awful - Keep Looking Is My Advice: My wife was drawn to this particular grater/slicer because of the large drum. She felt that she wouldn't have to fill the shoot as often as she does with another grater.  And for that, it works well.<br /><br />As with most other rotary graters, the suction platform is lacking.  It takes quite a bit to lock this grater down to the counter and with large projects it comes loose.  Very irritating.<br /><br />She was also disappointed by the drum being so close to the counter - it's difficult to find a bowl that fits nicely underneath to catch the food.  She said that something rectangular in shape, fitting flush against the cutter, would be better for catching all the food.<br /><br />The blades do both install and remove very easily.  The hand crank works well - and she particularly likes that it locks on. It's a mess to clean after shredding cheese.  Vegetables are easier, as it can just be rinsed.<br /><br />Would be nice if it had a 'dice' blade too.  I will use it but I would not recommend it to a friend.",3.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

"Mixed feelings on this one: The Husband Hunt was a nice read but it is a typical love story, that has been told over and over. Male lead falls for a girl he sees on TV. Then when he gets a chance to meet her, to make sure she is the one, we get mixed messages from him. Jaxie is trying to get her old boyfriend back even if he is not really what she wants. After meeting Crane (David) she sees in him, a man who can give her what she needs, a nice loving dependable husband, house, kids, dogs? She comes away as being a little shallow. I am on the fence with this one, but if you like a light &#34;love story with a happy ending&#34;, you may like this one.",3.0,Unknown,0,32
"This book has everything a good book should have, in spades.: Another visit with Leo and Serendipity is just as exciting, interesting and entertaining as the first. Serendipity is wonderful as the precocious, wise-cracking teen, and the interactions between her and Leo are fabulous. Each manages to get into one scrape after another as they probe a case that leads into the dark side of Hollywood and greater LA.  The plot is ingenious, the perils are great, and the saves are believable.  The menagerie of characters, both old and new, makes this a great and entertaining read, without taking anything from the underlying mystery. This book has everything a good book should have, in spades.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

Apply it gradually to ea section (6-8 sprays in your hand, no more than 10sprays, rub hands & apply. Use a cotton ball to apply 2sprays to top of feet & hands). It doesnt turn you orange but tan!

"Gets the job done.: We have the ikea potty seat and needed a second to keep at Grandma's house, and I couldn't get another ikea one, so I ordered this one.<br /><br />I think the splash guard on this one is a little smaller, so it was an adjustment, and we still occasionally have a little pee escape. I also prefer the ikea seat because it's a little more streamlined and easier to clean.<br /><br />However. We decided to keep this one at home and take the ikea seat to Grandma's because the winning feature on this one is the handles. My son would sometimes put the ikea seat on backwards, or have trouble getting it to sit properly on the toilet, because, you know, he was two years old. The handles on this one made it so much easier for my little guy to get the seat onto the toilet by himself. He also likes to grip the handles when he's really... concentrating on doing his business. 💩<br /><br />All in all, a great seat.

"Overall it’s great, but heat distribution remains spotty: This is the second mattress pad I have purchased by Sunbeam. This one is far more comfortable as I do not feel the wires at all when I am sitting on the bed or sleeping in the bed. I am short, so the reviewers who feel the plug at the foot of the bed are taller than me. I am 4’11” so no way do I feel that plug with my legs or feet. My only complaint is the heat is not evenly dispersed throughout the mattress pad. The first one I had only heated at the top and the foot of the bed, the center did not heat as much, if at all. This more recent version has more heat dispersed but it is still not at 100%.<br />I love climbing into a pre-heated bed on a cold night. The dual temperature settings work well, but the heat dispersed on both sides has the same spotty coverage.  I will say that my cats love the heated mattress pad.

"Totally impressed!: I have an older (1060) Honda Accord with over 250,000 miles on it. I don't drive it often, and as you can guess, the battery dies. After a recent cold spell I found that my ancient battery charger had died also. So while searching online for a charger, I came across the Brightech ad and decided to give it a try, not really confident that it would work, but impressed by the reviews. I ordered one, charged it overnight, and tried it on the Honda. Nothing. But I decided to give it another shot after warming the motor up. I jump started the car using my Toyota and, taking the Brightech with me, drove 30 miles to town. I parked facing down a hill before shutting the motor off, figuring that if the battery hadn't charged enough to start the car, I could coast it to start if the Brightech didn't work. Well, the battery was still dead, but the Brightech started the motor instantly. Not only once, but also after the next three times I stopped to shop. It still showed 3 green lights, and I discovered that my original problem was not getting into the car quickly enough to hit the starter within the 30 second window before the Brightech went back to sleep. After I got home, I parked the Honda (battery still dead-dead cell?) and let it sit for 2 weeks. This afternoon I hooked it up to the Brightech again (which, by the way, still showed a full charge) and it cranked over like crazy and started it!  Marvelous little tool!

I have used them for about a month and still didn't have to recharge the case.  There are a couple of hiccups, which I found tolerable.  They will unpair when phone goes dead or gets turned off, which can fix on its own or once phone is restarted and re-paired again.

If you've purchased one of the Black and White series statues you know that part of the Styrofoam box has a sort of T section where it really fits into place at the top center of the box. This T section was taped, but not actually closed completely. The next sign was that when I took the Styrofoam out of the decorative box, there was a dirty hand print on the Styrofoam. There was also a section at the bottom of the Styrofoam box where it looked like there was several layers of tape or a retape.<br /><br />I opened the Styrofoam box after cutting the tape, the bag the statue comes in was actually taped into the Styrofoam box tape, there were two chips in Batman's cape, one in a point, one on the inside of the cape, and one of Batman's boots appeared to have cracked or pushed through the inside of the cape.<br /><br />Generally, the statues that I order from Amazon aren't completely perfect, but this one was pretty damn bad.",1.0,Toys_and_Games,0,31

I was expecting this book to have so form of aliens walking around but this book is very human. ""The Healer's name was Fords Deep Waters. Because he was a soul, by nature he was all things good: compassionate, patient, honest, virtuous, and full of love."" This quote is describing a soul named Healer these souls are peaceful, and smart. They take over other life forms and then they move to another life form after they die in that body and life for thousands of years. ""You are the noblest, purest creature I've ever met. The universe will be a darker place without you. These were his words over my grave, my epitaph, and I was glad that I got to hear them."" These are the words from Doc who is taking Wanda out of Mel. Then Wanda says her last thought before she is taken out of Mel's body.This happened when Wanda decided to leave mel's body and let her be with her lover Jared.

"Could easily have been a 5 star review: Updated review:<br />While I basically love this pill cutter it has one defect that couñd easily be fixed and would make it so much better.  Just tighten up the specs a little bit.  The plastic top that has the blade in it has a little wiggle room: meaning there's a little room to get offf-center and end up with different sized &#34;halves&#34;.  If the plastic top fit a little tighter this wouldn't be an issue.  As it is, I get it all lined up, get my sternum directly over the pill cutter, mutter an incantation and pop it down with as equal force left, right, front, and back as possible.  Usually with pretty good results.  But it could be so much better so easily!!!<br />Old review:<br />I cut round pills in quarters.  I use this item to get them into 1/2s, then a regular cutter to make quarters.  I know you can use this for quarters, but it's difficult to stack them correctly for that.  It's easier to just use a regular cutter for the quartering.  Still this saves a lot of time if you cut a significant amount of pills regularly.  I do 10/night and I find that it's best to do 5 and 5, rather than all 10 at once.  It will do 10, but the ends seem a little iffy.  So 5 and 5 and I'm happy.",4.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Brilliant: Characteristically Russian novel - detailed (long) and nuanced (perplexing) with the sinuous threads of a complex plot. Relationships, familial and casual, are everything to this story. Souls tormented or tortured - another characteristic of the Russian novel (?) - are found in every chapter.<br /><br />The novel is long - Russian Style - with multiple threads of interaction - Dickens Like - and the characters are brought forth over time. Initially the interactions can be trivial, sometimes affected and melodramatic, but as Tolstoy develops the story a ‘tenseness’ sets in that you can’t take your eyes of. Tolstoy - like Dostoyevsky - is masterful at allowing the reader to listen to the thoughts of his characters. And even more masterful at describing the ebb and flood of thoughts and emotions that run through the minds of the characters, thoughts from grandiose to destructive:<br /><br />“The most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his head. ""Marie Sanina is glad her child’s dead.... How good a smoke would be now! ... To be saved, one need only believe, and the monks don’t know how the thing’s to be done, but Countess Lidia Ivanovna does know.... And why is my head so heavy? Is it the cognac, or all this being so queer?” (Location: 18,305)<br /><br />Anna, Levin, and Vronsky get featured treatment, but there are at least a couple dozen other characters that come and go, each nudging the reader’s perception of the three featured characters. And in the end there is both happiness and sadness and some profound understanding, especially for Levin:<br /><br />""Isn’t it distinctly to be seen in the development of each philosopher’s theory, that he knows what is the chief significance of life beforehand, just as positively as the peasant Fyodor, and not a bit more clearly than he, and is simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what everyone knows?""

"Death in a bag. Don't buy if you love your pet!!!!!: I recently (trustingly) purchased ""Canyon Creek Ranch"" brand ""Duck Tenders"" from a Petco store in Nampa, Idaho. I have been purchasing products from Petco stores for my Yorkshire Terrier since we got her as a puppy a year ago.  I dearly love my Yorkie and thought that this would be a nice treat for her training needs. I purchased a bag and began ""rewarding"" her with a jerky treat about once a day (instructions tell me that I can give more, but one is enough). As I write this, my precious Yorkie, Makena, is on her 2nd day of treatment to try to bring her out of renal failure directly caused by these ""treats"". Are you aware that the FDA has posted a warning with regards to this very brand of treat and that currently over 360 deaths have occurred and more than 2200 other pets have fallen ill as a direct result of this company's product? I implore  you to stop the sales of this product to your customers. If you really are a business that truly cares about pets, please stop. Losing a pet like Makena is so very hard. It is just like losing a member of the family. I am telling every pet owner I know about this. I understand business. I understand that you don't wish to lose profit. I also hope that you understand that selling products that are harmful is bad business. Please do the right thing and pull all products that have been purchased from Chinese mills. My veterinarian has stated, and the FDA articles back this up, that pretty much ""all pet food products from China should be avoided"".<br />[...]",1.0,Unknown,0,32

Best thing I ever bought.....: Best thing I ever bought for my Ford. I have a 2018 Ford F150 XLT 5.0L. I wanted to do my own oil change and found out that it will be super messy. I watched a few videos and everyone of them were messy. Someone said twist the yellow plastic drain plug (which I will never understand why plastic) and slowly twist it til the oil slowly comes through. Then hold it for 2 minutes. Doesn't work. I suggest hold it longer than 2 minutes. Like 5 minutes. I know to long but will be less of a mess. Anyway. Bought the Ronin because I've seen videos and many people recommend it. The price is high but it does exactly what it is designed to do and the name is pretty awesome (Ronin). The material is made of billet and you can never go wrong with that. It is only made for Fords that have the dreaded yellow drain plug. I recommend it to anyone that does not what to continue to have a mess. Buy it.

"Disjointed, grammatical errors, author notes still in ebook (?): Wanted to like this. I'm a fan of the Cussler-genre action novels, and was looking forward to finding a new author. This book, however, really disappoints.<br /><br />The basic story idea is good, but not exactly new ground here. Hero is the only hope against vast corporation. Big business throws impossible force to stop him. Good vs. evil, etc.<br /><br />But the story falls apart, with multiple (unnecessary) flashbacks to characters and events we already know the outcome of. And when I say multiple flashbacks, they are too common to count. It doesn't go to show character motivation, as much as it looks like ""I don't know where to go with this story next, maybe I should recount something already told once again.""<br /><br />Corporate evil, in this case utility distribution networks (!), are given a lot of leeway in their actions here. They control local sherrifs, black-ops mercenaries work in their offices, hi level politicians (with ties to the President), even the latest military spycraft (flying saucers!) are just a phone call away. Thank God our hero went to West Point, or all hope would be lost.<br /><br />Most annoying is that there appear to be notes from the author in the ebook, reflecting perhaps that even he is confused by his own story. There is an exchange between black-ops agents tracking our hero where the following passage appears in brackets:<br /><br />>>>>>  [Is this Eagle Six speaking? Shooter One? Thought it was Eagle Six, but that's who speaks next].<br /><br />And then Eagle six speaks. Seems our author lost track of his own story here. But it shows a lack of proofreading here, which is rife throughout the book. Lots of grammatical errors throughout the book.<br /><br />Overall, not very well written, too many flashbacks spoil the story flow, not well edited.<br /><br />Sorry Matt, but this book has too many flaws to recommend.  Better luck next time.",1.0,Books,0,7

"BRIGHT, but a bit flimsy and a tight fit.: Visibility:  excellent.  It's BRIGHT neon yellow with orange liners around silver reflectors.<br /><br />Durability:  good but I've seen better.  It's a jersey-style mesh material.  The pockets seem pretty flimsy but they're there.  Two big belly pockets that might hold a calculator and a tape measure, and a series of chest pockets for a cell phone and a few pencils.  All pockets are exterior and the vest has a plastic zipper up the middle.  There are no &#34;emergency break-away&#34; points.<br /><br />Size:  SMALLER THAN NORMAL.  I typically wear an XL-tall shirt (emphasis on the TALL).  I ordered the one labeled &#34;XL&#34; but it fits more like a standard &#34;LARGE.&#34;  So when you order these vests make sure you get something ONE size bigger than your shirt if you're going to put it over a t-shirt, or TWO sizes bigger if you're putting it over a coat for cool-weather work.  Also, because they don't carry tall sizes, the bottom of the vest was about two inches above my belly button.  It's hard to find good clothes if you're tall.  Really though, since it's just for visibility enhancement and not meant as a real piece of clothing I can put up with that.

"4 year old tested and loved: My 4 year old has been really into collecting all our coins around the house and so we decided that she could get a &#34;piggy bank&#34; to store her coins in.  We searched on amazon with her, and this was the piggy bank she chose. She wanted the blue pig, not the pink pig or the elsa bank. When it arrived she was so excited. It is the perfect size (I was worried that for $10 we were going to get a teeny tiny piggy bank- but that was not the case) and while it is ceramic so it is fragile, it isn't so fragile that her 4 year old hands can't handle this or empty it as needed. The bottom plug goes on/off easily so she is constantly filling it and emptying it to play with her coins. Overall, I have no complaints, it looks just like the picture and functions just as one would expect from a child's piggy bank. I would recommend to anyone looking for a blue piggy bank.",5.0,Toys_and_Games,1,31

"A Hopeful Introduction to the Anthropocene Era: Perhaps the best thing about this book is the sense of hopefulness it conveys. Yes, we are in the midst of what many now call the Anthropocene Era, a period in which our impact on nature and capacity to change it in fundamental ways poses a threat to our very survival as a species. That's the scary part.<br /><br />We're no longer participants on a passive stage. Nature is now a participant in the human drama. Our capacity to influence it, to remake it, in ways large and small has exploded since the Industrial Age began two centuries ago. Ackerman reminds us of the loss of pastoral sympathy, but she is no Luddite. She welcomes the new era.<br /><br />Ackerman's genius is her sense that so much is possible. Whether in cell biology, alternative energy sources, plant science, or nanotechnology, our horizons are expanding at a seemingly exponential rate. Ackerman has managed to capture the energy and excitement of Anthropocene activities in a way that almost conveys something like hope. I read the book online, which caused me to neglect the footnotes. I'm now ordering a hard copy to spend more time lolling through the citations. The book is gold mine.<br /><br />The only thing that prevented me from giving this book five stars was Ackerman's overly poetic style. She is a gifted writer, but, from time to time, the metaphors distracted from the narrative. She was too breathless, too filled with wonder, too rapt. Her wonderful writing sometimes got in the way. It's a forgivable sin.",4.0,Books,1,7

I tried to just combine the wax pieces, but one side of the plastic was almost impossible to remove.  Even when using just a single piece of wax, it didn't seem to work as well as other waxes I've used before.",2.0,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,0,3

"My wife chuckled when I said this film nearly made me cry: I guess if it's okay for her to get choked up watching all that Jane Austen stuff, then it's okay for me to have to fight back a few tears while watching little Joey run after his hero.<br /><br />SHANE is one of the best westerns ever made.  It captures the essence of this American mythology and offers superb quality in a such a wide array which one rarely sees anymore.  For instance, the acting was just right; never over-the-top, never one-dimensional and boring, and never emotionally manipulative.  The camera shots were top notch and could easily compete with any western/epic of the last twenty years.  The action was fast-paced and intense, and yet this film is not ruled by the action sequences.  The characters carry this film, not the action.  The characters are likeable and very believable.<br /><br />But perhaps my favorite thing about SHANE is the presence of the hero who on the surface appears too nice and too meek (the nice tough guy, if you will).  But at the right time, he is a force to be reckoned with.  Another of my favorite examples of this would have to be James Stewart in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN.<br /><br />SHANE is one of the few films I've watched recently (for the first time in a long time) which left me wondering, ""Why in the world have I not bought this yet?""",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Another Hilarious Installment in the Deadwood Mystery Series: Devil Days in Deadwood is another hilarious installment in the Deadwood Mystery Series (Book 11).  Violet and her zany paranormal posse continue to learn more about themselves and each other as they continue to persevere in their fight against Deadwood's evil spirits.<br />This is one of my favorite book series. Here’s why:<br />1. The humor is a direct hit to my funny bone.<br />2. Their capers & antics are fun, heart-starting and always heartwarming.<br />3. The History of Deadwood plays a big role in the “spooky” element of these mysteries.<br />4. The characters are flawed, daffy, lovable & foul-mouthed at times. They argue with hysterical swordplay and love each other to the depth of their deranged souls.<br />5. Ann Charles knows how to write incredibly entertaining books. At the end of each book it leaves you with all the warmth of the Holidays with family & friends and you can’t wait for the next gathering.<br />The Deadwood Series is a humorous mystery series with a splash romance. The audio version is excellent as the narrator really brings the characters to life.  You must read/listen in order.  Start with “Nearly Departed in Deadwood” and let the characters lead you through a hysterically funny, heartwarming adventure.  I’m going to start my 4th time through the series as I wait for Book 12. #AnnWCharles #DevilDaysInDeadwood #DeadwoodMysterySeries #Humor #Mystery #DeadwoodDeputy",5.0,Books,1,7

"Enjoyed this series: I liked this book, but I&#039;m not surprised since I have liked the other books in this series also.<br /><br />This is the story of Jewel, a reality home improvement host coming off an embarrassing incident on her show (which was fueled from her husband having an affair with the producer) and Mason, a real estate agent that can never seem to make his mega wealthy father proud.  Both decided to move to Aspen Cove for different reasons, but similar in that both wanted a fresh start.<br /><br />Mason has an ultimatum from his father - sell two houses for a profit within 60 days or he can kiss his very hefty trust fund goodbye.  Mason decides to coerce Jewel into helping him and before it&#039;s all over, her deadbeat ex-husband and ex-producer have joined them filming (it didn&#039;t take folks long to realize that Jewel was the brains behind the show).  In the end, everything is great - HEAs and the deadbeats get what they deserve.  But it&#039;s a fun ride getting to that point.<br /><br />I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.

Several of us tuck these into purses or backpacks, so the locking lid gets a lot of use.  Some things handy to know..<br /><br />- when you fill the mug, only fill it to BELOW the bottom of the threads on the base.  If filled too high, it will leak since it doesn’t seal well.  To test this after you fill it, upend sealed mug over a sink.  If it drips, unscrew it, wipe the outside threaded portion, and close it again.<br />- if you break a top, go to the contigo web site and you can order JUST a locking lid.

I've roasted eight batches at 8oz each so far between city and Full City+. This coffee has been disappointing all around for the price. It is best around Full City roast IMO.

"MAGICAL BUNNY: My son LOVES his bunny!  We started putting it is his crib at about 6 weeks old, in hopes that he would find comfort in it.  He is now 1.5 years old, and he still sleeps with his bunny every night.  He loves to cuddle it and tickle his face with bunny's ears.  He grabs it as soon as we put him in his crib.  When he was younger, if he ever needed to soothe himself with his pacifier, bunny was easily within grasp and the perfect size for infant hands.  This bunny is MAGICAL and I will buy it for every new mom I know! Love, love, love!!!",5.0,Baby_Products,1,5
"Brand New and Leaking: This bottle arrived today and I had really high hopes. Sadly I was disappointed right off the bat. The product image makes this look like a sunshine yellow (akin to a hydro flask) but actually it’s the color of the paper amazon packaging or of a school bus. It’s an orange yellow and not at all what I wanted. Still, I was really excited to have a metal camelbak because I like straw water bottles and the ability to keep water cold without condensation. However, even after taking care to follow the wash instructions (I even hand washed everything), the bottle was leaking upon first use. Usually in the past I could drop my camelbak a few times before it started to leak out of the mouth piece but this did it right away. There’s not really a point to a leaky water bottle so I’m very upset over this purchase.",1.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

"I highly recommend this charger to any Wii owner: I love my Wii and I play it often, and I like to use the protective sleeves to provide cushioning, enhance grip, and minimize accumulation of dirt on my controllers. If you're like me, your biggest Wii-related nuisance is changing the batteries in your controllers.<br /><br />Batteries are expensive, and even if you have rechargeables it's a pain to remove the sleeve in order to replace them. Even if you have a regular charger, you still most likely have to remove the Nunchuk and the Motionplus, if not the sleeve as well.<br /><br />That's where induction charging comes in. The same technology that powers your electric toothbrush allows you to charge your remotes without any contact with the metal components. Just pop your remotes in place: Motionplus, Nunchuk and all if you like. A magnet holds them in position on the stand (stylishly, in my opinion) and a blue light lets you know that they're charging. A green light indicates a full charge, which is easily enough for your average play session. An on/off switch allows you to avoid wasting power while your remotes are already charged or off the base.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this charger; it's the type of charging system that Nintendo should have included with the Wii, in my opinion.<br /><br />One word of caution: the charger uses battery packs which are attached to their own battery compartment cover. This means that if you carry these to a friend's house and try to sync them with another Wii, you might have a hard time, as you have to remove the battery pack to access the sync button. I recommend carrying a spare set of batteries if you travel with your remotes.",5.0,Video_Games,1,33

It's small and lightweight enough to keep it in the trunk or frunk of the i3.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-lightweight<br />-compactness<br />-easy to use<br />-pump is accurate<br />-digital psi read out is pretty accurate<br /><br />Cons:<br />-the screw-in valve losses air when screwing and unscrewing from the tire after proper tire inflation/PSI have been reached<br />-wish the power cord is 5 feet longer so it can reach both front/rear tires on larger vehicles<br /><br />Minus 1 star because of the ""screw-in valve"" style.<br /><br />This would be a perfect product if EPAuto would change the screw-in valve to a clap style valve so I can instantly lock and un-lock the valve quickly from the tire without losing too much air.",4.0,Automotive,1,4

"Diverse Character Driven Coming-of-Age Story!: If you're looking for an incredibly written, messy family drama with lots of representation and multilayered with heavier themes, this is the one.<br /><br />It's an emotional, character driven coming-of-age story with Morgan, a nonbinary teenager navigating their identity, their first relationship, and reconnecting with their estranged alcoholic mother.<br /><br />I really felt for all of these characters and loved the POVs of each Morgan, Julian, Zoe, and Brigid. I do wish there were more happy moments mixed in with the struggles to give them more depth; like their personhood was wrapped up in their trauma, which made it harder to get a sense of them as a whole.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this one. It was a solid 4 star read til the end, I just didn't connect with the resolution. But I would definitely read a follow-up on these characters if that's in the cards.<br /><br />Feltman is such a talented writer, I'll look forward to seeing more from her!<br /><br />I received a free copy from the publisher, all opinions are my own.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Not the product it was pre pandemic: I hope folks reading reviews sort by most recent!<br /><br />I have used this product for years and pre 2020 would have given it a 5 star rating.

"Clean book that's perfect for a middle grade student looking for something to read.: I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Looking for a good book for a middle grade student?  Try Chronicles from Chateau Moines. There isn't any foul language or inappropriate situations, only an innocent kiss at the end. It blends cultures together with anti-war and anti-racism themes. Even when there is conflict within the book, the characters aim to restore the peace.<br /><br />After the death of his mother, Scott Sweet moves to Chateau Moines, France with his sister and father. While there he makes new friends and together they plan a protest for the Vietnam War. Sylvie, on the other hand, has to chose between her friend who likes Scott, or Scott himself. Since it is told through her point of view as well, of course she has to choose the new American boy.<br /><br />Sylvie is my least favorite character in the book. She was very moody for more than half of the book. She kept fighting her crush of Scott because her friend said she liked him first. When she ditched her friend to meet with Scott, I thought she'd loosen up and become less of a stick in the mud. That didn't happen. Even when around Scott, she doesn't try to get very close to him. At times the reminder of him puts her in a bad mood around her friends and family. The only way she opens up about her feelings is through her writing. Throughout the book, readers see the poems/lyrics she writes.<br /><br />Scott, on the other hand, is a bit strong willed--after all he won't wear socks until the war is over. He isn't as moody as Sylvie. He is the peacekeeper in the book. He befriends an Arabian boy, Ibrahim, and tries to be friends with Sylvie--if she will let him. Yes, Scott makes a false assumption in the book, but when he learns the truth, he quickly forgets the grudge he had against a certain adult character. He is a good leader.<br /><br />In the end, the book closes with no loose ends. There is a nice twist that interconnects all of the characters. Astute readers will be able to figure out what this revelation is about half way through the book. It makes for a very happy ending.<br /><br />Since the setting is in France, author Evelyne Holingue incorporates some French language in the book. Most of the French words/phrases are translated. Those that aren't can easily be deciphered with the context clues. This is one aspect of the book I really enjoyed her including. I'm glad the language wasn't all in English.<br /><br />The story is told over the course of a school year in 1970-1971. Historical events are brought up in the book.  Holingue also incorporates music all throughout. Since Scott plays guitar and Sylvie sings, music from the era is cited. Holingue lists the songs at the end of the book along with the album and year published. You'll definitely want to check it out.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Not in love with the flavor or the price: I made these overnight oats using both methods - microwaved (1st pic) and overnight (2nd pic). There really was not much, if any, difference in the oats themselves either way you made them - one didn't expand more than the other and the flavor was no different either method. Kind of seemed like it was just easier to microwave it when you are ready to eat it. I ended up microwaving the overnight ones anyway because I could not get past eating them cold. It was gross. The oats come in pint sized looking container, which is needed to prevent spillage using the heating method but ends up feeling disappointing when you see how small the serving actually is - about 1/4 of that container. What I love about these is the 25G of protein from egg whites and collagen. For a small serving, it does have a little staying power after you eat it and that's nice. It's also gluten and dairy free and lower sodium. I don't hate the flavor, but I don't love it either. It's okay. Yes, it has blueberries, and it doesn't taste bad but it's also extremely sweet - not in a great way - it's far sweeter than it needs to be.  The crunchy topping looks like crushed up waffle ice cream cones. They don't actually add any crunch and they get soggy fast. I'd be fine just leaving them completely out and saving those calories. The price is a killer on these. There's no way I'd be happy about paying $4.25 for one container based on what you get. Overall, I find this product to be mostly disappointing. The nutritional value gives it the stars; the rest is a letdown.",3.0,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,0,14

"Great Feeder but read the instructions: We use this feeder to take care of cats, (mousers) at one of our remote barns. It works like a champ.  The only thing to watch out for is this feeder automatically detects food in the tray and will not dispense to prevent waste. Some might believe it's inoperative, intermittent, and undependable.  This has not been the case for ours.  Once the food is cleared from the opening it continues to dispense food.  The only improvement they could have made to it is to allow for external AC power. It's powered by 4 D cell batteries and has a low voltage warning indicator. Be nice to have the batteries as backup power or the option to operate it either way. This food dispenser is very well designed and constructed. I highly recommend it.",5.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26

So after applying extra twist, each bulb slipped into place and the whole strand lit up perfectly! Yep, that simple, and I felt dumb for not correctly screwing in a light bulb!

Very disappointing: I read like the 1st 5 chapters and returned the book (it was a NYPL loan). The first 5 chapters focused too heavily on crime. It was less of what I thought it might be - highlighting the reasons behind normal everyday situations to root causes via economic observations and models. There were some instances of this but very subdued and quickly passed over. There were even repeats of the same topics within the 5 chapters I read. Very disappointing.

"High Couch of Silistra, first volume of the Silistra ...: High Couch of Silistra, first volume of the Silistra Quartet. This novel changed the game for women characters in speculative literature and writers of science fiction. Based in myth but set far from Earth,  it's a provocative read about one women's quest to find her father,  her identity, her destiny. Estri, the main character, changes her world  and the readers' minds. Still challenging today, this book talks about the genetics of behavior, and the hard-wired nature of sex and passion. Janet Morris examines women's equality,sexuality, and power. At Silistra's core is philosophical fiction, speculative  fiction that asks questions more crucial today than when this book was written -- about the place of male and female principles in the universe. In High Couch of Silistra we confront problems of philosophy, biology, sexuality, and power. Full of action and adventure, High Couch of Silistra is not simply a space adventure, layered as it is with politics and science and metaphysics. It examines issues that make you think, set in a far-distant dystopia where the reader can see more clearly.  More akin to Animal Farm than Star Wars, Silistra is a must for thoughtful readers coming of age and coming to terms with being human.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Empathetic, realistic, and approachable take on the topic of mental health for MG readers: Four and a half stars from me.<br /><br />The more I read of Barbara Dee’s Middle Grade books, the bigger fan I become of her writing. Dee’s new book My Life In The Fish Tank offers an approachable, empathetic, and realistic take on the topic of mental health. She does this with an engaging plot, relatable characters, and humor that will engage Middle Grade readers.<br /><br />Our main character Zinny’s life is turned upside down when her older brother Gabriel is diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. How her family deals with the situation surrounding the diagnosis is a big part of the plot. And how they deal with it? Not well, unfortunately. Through this chaos Dee manages to keenly reflect the tween perspective, the complexities of family – and in particular, family loyalty.<br /><br />Mom is distracted, Dad is in hiding, and they both don’t want Gabriel’s diagnosis to get out. This makes Zinny pull away from her friends who just want to help. The book captures the loneliness that can result from keeping secrets. I think it also does a great job at normalizing different situations that tweens might stigmatize, such as speaking with a counselor or attending the lunchtime counseling group. Overall, it takes a healthy approach to discussing mental health.<br /><br />“Because one thing you notice, when those bad things happen, is that calendars and clocks stop making any sense. Even if they still work perfectly okay, even if the batteries are good, and the cords are still plugged in…they don’t communicate anything useful. Or even anything your brain can understand.<br />At least that’s how it seemed in our house.<br />It was like, after it happened, we were in a different time zone from everyone else.<br />A parallel universe.<br />And we needed some kind of new, not-yet-invented time measurement. Abnormal Standard Time.”<br /><br />As expected, Dee captures the middle school voice perfectly. Zinny’s is funny, honest, and drew me right into the story. I thought her siblings (and her relationship with them) was well developed and relatable, too. She also has a great teacher who subtly helps her navigate the situation. (I love seeing strong teacher role models in books.) The book is age-appropriate for the subject matter and while geared for MG readers, it is wonderful for all ages.<br /><br />I received a copy of the book for review purposes. All opinions are my own!",4.0,Books,1,7
"Great value: I've always had issues with flexibility as a frequent gym goer, and recently have had real problems with Sciatica from tight hamstrings and quads. I was recommended this by my physio - and I'm so impressed!! I'm mixing it with a regular stretching routine after training, but then also using it a few mornings a week to help activate my back muscles and make me more agile for the day.<br /><br />You don't need to use it very long each day, but it really makes a difference and is easy to use. I recommend to do some research online on how to use it first as there are different areas to target with the different applicators.<br /><br />I chose this gun because I wanted something which had several applicators to work on different groups, and several speed options. One of the major decision factors for me was the noise level, as I'd read reviews that many were not quiet. This percussion gun is super quiet!! I couldn't believe it, if you're like me and don't want a black & decker drill going off when you're trying to relax - then look no further.",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Love love love my Berkey: I am in love with my Berkey Water Purifier. Prior to purchasing the Berkey, I was not drinking enough water. However since receiving my Berkey, I have increased my water intake substantially. The increase is due to the fresh, clear taste of the water which does not have the smell or taste of regular filtered water. The water produced by the Berkey taste clean and does not have a after taste, which makes you feel satisfied and eager to drink more water. The Berkey is rather expensive but is worth the money when you consider the overall effect on your health due to a greater intake and a lack of contaminates in the water. I very highly recommend Berkey water purifiers to anyone concerned about contaminates in water and who do not like the taste of ""dirty"" water.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"Easy to install and use: We just installed this gate in the door frame (no door) between our den and kitchen. It was pretty easy to install; the directions had clear pictures of each step and were definitely written by someone who speaks English as a first language. My husband and I each did some of the work while the other watched the baby and it took about 2 hours. We just used the screws that were provided and it was fine even though some reviewers suggested using galvanized ones; we were putting it right into wood with no drywall or other materials.<br /><br />The opening mechanism is simple to use with one hand and it swings open all the way. We also like that there is no threshold to walk over. It's a simple design so it's not bulky. The 9-month-old baby has already pulled herself up on it and it is sturdy. The cats can also jump over it no problem.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars only because we literally just finished installing it so I can't speak to how it lasts.<br /><br />UPDATE: After a few months of regular use the gate is working just fine. The baby does like to use it for standing. And the cats took about a week to adjust having to jump over it, but they eventually accepted their annoyance with it.

"Stellar New Talent.: Alela Diane Menig, whose father Tom produces and also appears on this album, hails from Nevada City, and only started to write and play in 2003. `The Pirate's Gospel' was originally recorded in her father's home studio and self released in 2004. Apparently she came to the attention fellow Nevada City native Joanna Newsom, who arranged her first live show. The album got a bit of a polish and an `official' release in 2006.<br /><br />I've seen this artist compared to Gillian Welch, Jolie Holland, and Josephine Foster. I am most strongly reminded of The Be Good Tanyas and would add them to the list. Which isn't to say she sounds, that much, like any of the former, but that like those other performers, she seems to have reached far into the past for her musical inspiration, before giving it a twist of her own. In the process she has created a sound that, while rooted firmly in earlier times, is fresh, vibrant and ultimately timeless.<br /><br />I guess this is a folk album(that's how most reviewers have categorised it)but all the songs are self-penned, and musically, it has a blend of styles that would place it outside of any specific folk tradition. As well as folk I hear a touch of blues, gospel and with all the piratical references, there is a nautical flavour too. Forget all that though, because the thing that makes this album so good is the quality of the songs.<br /><br />The album opens strongly with `Tired Feet' a deceptively simple tune that you may find lodged in your head for days, thereafter the record never flags, sure some of the songs are stronger than others(the title track, `Clickity Clack' and `Oh My Mama' are just three of my favourites)but all the songs hang together to create a perfectly gorgeous album. Considering this was essentially a `home recording' you would never know it, as all the performances are of the highest standard. I realise I haven't mentioned her richly soulful voice, which matches the quality of the material beautifully.<br /><br />Incidentally there are three(!)different versions of this CD around at the moment.The American release with the(pirate?)ship on the cover which, perhaps, has the nicest packaging(gatefold cardboard sleeve and better photo on the insert)but only has 11 tracks. The UK edition(rather unflattering portrait of Alela on the cover)has the original 11 track album and 2 bonus tracks `Heavy Walls' and `Gypsy Eyes' which are well worth having(strangely though they are not listed on the Amazon product page or anywhere on the CD case). Finally there is an Australian import available(in both ship and portrait!)which also has 2 bonus tracks (but `Pink Roses' Substitutes for `Gypsy Eyes')the same gatefold sleeve as the American release(but with a slightly different insert)and features an `enhanced' section containing a video for `Pieces Of String'. How do I know? Yes I did buy all three(starting with the US version)so I could get all the tracks. Trust me she is THAT good.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of solo-female artists around at the moment but don't let this one get lost in the crowd. Alela Diane is a fabulous talent. Don't miss out.",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

I get a lot of compliments on the overall dress and especially the color which is a much deeper green than the picture shows.  The lace is SO soft, it was entirely unexpected.

"On rising after the fall: I recently ‘lost’ a consulting job and resigned from another, at the same time, and went into self-reinvention mode immediately. I’d had my own professional services practice for a while, juggling my business writing projects with project management and consulting for Fortune 1000s and 500s. In the midst of my very real desire to dedicate myself to my own business, and to succeed as a white-collar hired hand, life made a decision for me. I had no choice. I needed to rebrand, resurge and be successful really quick. So I turned to the next natural customer pool for my business: my acquaintances, former customers and former employers. My network.<br /><br />And while my business shyly strives, I found a priceless resource to inspire and guide my rebranding efforts. Suzanne Garber, a wildly successful former executive with FedEx and a multinational emergency evacuation corporation, wrote a very on-point book on the oh-so-common loss of professional status. She recently published &#34;SAFETY NETwork&#34;, a collection of real-life stories of hard-working, smart, accomplished C-level executives who lose their place in the professional world. This is not a tale of loss and finding peace with the shift: this is an empowering account about taking the reins of your seismic shift and making it work for you. It's a great read, and aside from the sobering, enlightening and inspiring accounts, the book offers a valuable list of resources for networking, which Ms. Garber drives as the ultimate tool for a very necessary reinvention.<br /><br />I highly recommend it as a go-to source of invaluable guidance through what can be one of life's most challenging and empowering experiences. Yes, you may have lost your job, but you didn’t lose what got you there. Reclaim it.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Completely Disappointed: When I ordered this product I was expecting a cooling beast that was ultra quiet.  I am sorry to say I was completely disappointed.  First is the back retention plate.  It has two self sticking foam stand offs, that they tell you to adhere to the plate and the motherboard.  That should scream no to any computer builder, because you will never be able to remove them intact to use on another build.  The retention plate is plastic and uses a molded slot for a steel retaining nut. The slot is so easily stripped, it's not even funny.  The hoses and wiring come out of the right side of the pump, if you want the words NZXT upright you could have clearance problems with slot one of ram.  The fans are no better than average case fans and make noise equivalent to that.  The pump itself is dead silent but that hardly matters with the fans making the noise.  The last thing to surprise me was the cooling efficiency and by surprised I mean how weak it was.  My builds with the corsair H100 and the CoolerMaster Hyper 212EVO both easily out performed it.  The Corsair H100 out was superior in cooling.  The Hyper 212EVO is more quieter even with two fans in a push pull.",3.0,Electronics,0,12
"Don't waste your money.: I have bought 3 of these now. Not because they are awesome, but because they are absolute s***, and I have to keep replacing the digital sensor part. The fill valve - the one I got came with fill valve and wiring, etc. - works great... WHEN you have a working sensor attached. The sensors go bad after 6 or 8 months. I think the longest I've had one last was a whopping 9 months. I have a 2,000 gallon koi pond that is filled from a shallow well. When we bought the property, the previous owner had a giant float (looked like a giant version of the old-style toilet floats) in the pond attached to the fill valve. Very simple and efficient design but it was hideous. I could never find a pond supply place or any &#34;expert&#34; that could tell me of a better way. After researching and researching for about 2 years, I found this thing. Thought it was the perfect solution. It's great when it works, but if you dare purchase this thing, just plan on replacing the little sensor bit about twice a year. I wouldn't waste the money... Problem is I have no idea what else to use. Back to the drawing board for me.",1.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

The glitter is not textured and it doesn't peel, so it's perfect for pulling in and out of a bag. Whatever it's made of also doesn't seem to collect dirt or colour, it just stays perfectly white and glittery. Clipped on great, looks great, does a great job protecting. 10/10.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"only to be disappointed. I may be completely wrong but suspect this ...: After 600 Hours of Edward, I looked forward to The Summer Son, only to be disappointed.  I may be completely wrong but suspect this may have been an early effort by Lancaster, and dusted off after the success of 600 Hours of Edward.  It purports and tries to be about the most human of issues, estrangement and reconciliation, but somehow there's not enough there.  The father is never as fully drawn as he needs to be for us to truly understand and sympathize and the son seems more petulant than really damaged....and, perhaps, more curious than yearning.  The final secret felt completely tacked on, was one  too many, and was unnecessary and unrealistic, in my opinion.  It felt like something Lancaster added because he was not confident that the foregoing angst was sufficient.  Basically The Summer Son was a series of scenes between two men who couldn't or wouldn't communicate; maybe it was too &#34;real&#34;...... which may have accounted for my frustration.

There is an edge and an appeal that's present with this album that I think will draw casual observers in.  Eddie and the guys rip it up on this very solid effort, and you get a very good vibe after the first two or three tunes, and, it get's better with each track.  The tour will be incredible.

"Saved my iPhone!: Tech Armor is little thick for a screen protector, but I'll take that for the protection it provides. The company claims that these screen protectors will sacrifice themselves for your phone screen, and in my experience, that's been completely true. I've broken one, and the fall definitely would have shattered the screen had it not been for the Tech Armor-- I slipped and fell in a wet parking lot while talking on the phone, and the phone went flying out of my hands from the impact, straight into the asphalt. Shattered screen cover (and ego), but intact phone. As careful as I am with my phone, that's the sort of unpreventable accident that this cover protects against. I've owned three iPhones over the course of 6 years and managed to not break a single one, but the parking lot incident would have been the end of that streak if not for the Tech Armor. It would have been a shame, since this is the first time I've owned the latest iPhone model!<br /><br />My sister has one of these on her phone as well, and she managed to break her Tech Armor when she chipped an edge of it; a couple of tiny hairline cracks spread from the chipped area, so she ended up just replacing it. Luckily, Amazon has a great price on these bad boys. They were ridiculously expensive at the phone store we went to when looking for a replacement. Are they worth the investment? Oh yeah. Cheaper than paying to get the screen fixed. But they'd be painful to replace if we had to pay that much every time one broke.<br /><br />I followed the instructions that come with the screen protector to the letter each time I installed it-- wash your hands, wipe the screen with the wet wipes, dry it with the cleaning cloth, remove any visible dust with the dust tape, then carefully install the cover. Because of that, I've never had problems with bubbles, dirt, or the edges lifting up. The phone screen is still completely useable, even though the glass feels thick. It resists scratching remarkably well; I haven't managed to scratch either of mine. The adhesive sticks hard enough to withstand everyday use; once it's on, it's not coming off until you want it off. Just be very careful removing it if you break it; the cracks spread when you pull off the cover, and it IS glass. :)",5.0,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,1,9
"Leather bracelet fanatic's new favorite bracelet!: For a multitude of reasons, my dirty shopping habit is the periodical purchase of new bracelets to don.  Most of my favorites have been from retail stores, mainly H&M.  However, this bracelet has risen to the very top of my list in terms of my favorite bracelets.<br />I've gone through a plethora of materials and have found that leather is the one I am most comfortable with (leather braided especially).  This bracelet has the standard leather braided feel to it, but is very stiff upon arrival.  This is not abnormal though; the stiffness usually wears away after a few weeks or so.  The braids are very closely fitted which is good because loose braids will have the bracelet falling apart rendering it useless.<br /><br />The two dragon heads are connected by a disk clasp that works similar to a key chain clip.  This is what has set it apart from all of the bracelet connectors I've experienced so far (hook on, magnetic, clasp, etc).  The dragons' mouths are open and have teeth grinding on each other.  The hollow created by this is where the disk connects both heads.  The ingenuity of incorporating this detail makes this bracelet unique and absolutely stunning.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a promotional price in exchange for an unbiased, honest review of the product after testing. Also, the opinions presented and testimony are my own and I was not compensated for the rating or review of this product.",5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"Fiction used to whitewash of history, from a British red diaper baby who still believes in Marx: This is my review of all six of David Downing's John Russell spy books. (The seventh, a prequel, I've not yet read.)<br /><br />Downing is a competent writer — never brilliant, never hilarious, never deeply insightful, but consistently entertaining. As a creator of plots, though, he's plodding and generally very predictable. At least two dozen times while reading these six books, I was drawn up short by the breathtakingly stupid holes in his plots. He seems to be vaguely aware of them, but instead of fixing them, he routinely resolves them through deux ex machina developments. As the series progresses, that becomes less and less acceptable.<br /><br />John Russell is clearly drawn as a heroic figure whom his creator admires and intends us to admire, but I nevertheless consciously resisted the increasingly strong inclinations to impute to author David Downing the political sentiments he puts into Russell's thoughts and words in these books. The curtain is finally pulled back to my satisfaction, however, in this blurb at the end of the sixth book, ""Masaryk Station,"" in a short ""Historical addendum,"" in which we find this:<br /><br />""It [East Germany] was finally torn down in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, and in the brief interregnum which followed socialist opponents of the East German regime debated the possibility of establishing something new in their country, a system which was neither capitalist nor Soviet communist, but an authentic German socialism which drew on the best of both systems.""<br /><br />So yes, David Downing is the proverbial post-WW2 British ""pink diaper baby"" — the exact kind of idiot who prevents himself from actually acknowledging the utter failure of ALL of Marx' political progeny.<br /><br />ALL SIX OF THESE BOOKS ARE PROFOUNDLY, REFLEXIVELY, AND CATEGORICALLY ANTI-AMERICAN THROUGHOUT. Downing literally recycles cold war propaganda from the post-WW2 Soviets. At one point, he very seriously equates Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia — regimes which each brutally murdered tens of millions — to America on grounds that the latter still had a segregated military force in WW2. He at least recognizes the magnitude of Hitler's evil, but claims that after Hitler was defeated, nothing was left except ""shades of gray."" For all his detail about Berlin streets and parks and such, then, he's completely missed the most basic of historical facts: Stalin killed more innocents than Hitler in total, but over a greater period of time.<br /><br />If I had it to do over again, despite the escapism provided by Downing's generally competent prose, I wouldn't spend the money on any of these books. Knowing that the author is indeed as big a fool as his protagonist, I can't respect him, the books, or the investment of time and money through which I've subsidized him.",2.0,Books,0,7

"Incredibly effective: It works! We were going to replace the toilet in an historic building because of the rust stains in the bowl. The whole thing was rusty orange from iron deposits. It took two treatments and a little scrubbing to make it look like new. I did use an alternate method from the manufacturer's instructions. First, turn off the water supply and flush the toilet twice to get out the water, then stuff something (I used an old rag in a plastic trash bag) to seal the opening at the bottom of the bowl. Next, heat enough water to completely fill the toilet bowl. Not boiling hot, but a bit hotter than tap water, maybe 140 degrees. Then mix two cups of Iron Out into the water. It will foam up a little. Then pour the hot water into the toilet bowl, filling it up to the rim. Let stand for at least a half hour and inspect for progress. Hot water speeds up the action of the Iron Out which shortens its active working time. I needed to repeat the process and let the bowl full of Iron Out sit for two hours on the second application. This stuff can also be used for water softening and washing white clothes so it's not dangerous in the way that lye or an acid would be. The little remaining stain where the iron deposit was actually thick scrubbed off with a Brillo pad. The group I work with on this restoration was incredulous and thought I had achieved the impossible.",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"HONESTLY NOT a GAME worth 60 bucks: ***Notation***: Any of the following information mentioned below can very easily be found anywhere on the web via youtube or common searches. When considering buying this product it is IMPORTANT to take into account the products &#34;FUNCTIONALITY&#34;. This particular version of the game for this platform DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO INSTALL THIS GAME ON YOUR CONSOLE, meaning that you are forced to play this game from the disc. End Notation 4/9/2014<br /><br />This game was developed on a supposedly &#34;Heavily modified version of the Source Engine&#34;. The Source Engine has been around a very long time. So has the Xbox360. So everything about the games playability, functionality, load times, latency, lag, unfortunately EVERYTHING about this game has &#34;forced the buyer&#34; to suffer from a level of functionality that developers have surpassed years ago.  Bluepoint Games (The game developer responsible for the Xbox360 version) has specifically and intentionally DENIED --&#62;you&#60;-- the ability to install this game upon your Hard Drive. Upon placing the game in the console you are prompted for an update and the option to &#34;Install&#34; the game has been removed completely.<br /><br />GRAPHICS: You can actually enjoy the games graphics for what they are, but they are nothing stellar. Its the same engine that &#34;Call of Duty&#34; has been developed on. So if you were in a hospital bed and a doctor needed to determine a &#34;Baseline&#34; for graphics youll see throughout the internet that the graphics are just base graphics. There is absolutely nothing stellar about any of the graphics.<br /><br />CUSTOMIZATION: This game offers the most basic customization. As a matter of fact &#34;who&#34; you look like as a foot soldier is determined by which primary weapon you are carrying. Even then, the loadout screen depicts a JPG image of a soldier. The weapons when customizing them are one dimensional JPG images. Basically, there is absolutely nothing customizable about anything other than picking what you want to use, shown to you by a one dimensional JPG image, followed by a one dimensional JPG image of a soldier or Titan, followed by JPG images of weapons in your loadout. All &#34;flat&#34; one dimensional images.... similar to when youd pick a character in Street Fighter on the Sega Genesis. So theres no immense development put into weapons nor soldiers nor titans. Very bland,<br /><br />PLAYABILITY: Ever since this most recent generation of consoles ability to install games it has benefitted not only YOU as a consumer but also those you play with by installing your game onto your consoles HD. I am well BEYOND the standard for any Internet Connection down/up speeds. So its important not to misunderstand when I say that they game forces everything to play WITH LAG, it forces you to HAVE drain on your console, it forces your games &#34;Frames per second&#34; to suffer. Why? Because your are now spinning and pulling data off of a game disc. This game suffers from lag, framerate drops, and connection speed issues because the DEVELOPER has forced you to play the game from a disc. In this day and age (last time I was subjected to this poor development of a game) theres no excuse for selling a product with absolutely NO DISCLOSURE of the inability to actually INSTALL the game. Hit registration, jumpy soldier movements, lag, framerate drops, connection issues all slowed down to an abysmal crawl because BLUEPOINT GAMES didn't want you to be able to install the game. Don't buy into this game. Youll have buyers remorse.<br /><br />Unless you have no standards. If you have no standards by all means waste your money. This game is NOT worth buying a new console for. &#34;Destiny&#34; is a game worth a new console. but this no talent azz clown watered down game that forces you to play from a disc isn't worth more than 28 bucks tops.<br /><br />Buying this game gets you:<br />-1 day 1 update<br />-ABSOLUTE Zero customization of soldiers and Titans<br />-SOLDIER Loadout customization of 3 weapons, a grenade, a boost, and a special ability<br />-Titan Loadouts of 1 primary, secondary, and an ability<br />-15 maps... That's it.<br />-A story mode that is so forgetful its not mentioned above<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />This game is the most basic watered down FPS Ive seen within the last decade. More importantly, this game isn't on a Dreamcast, This game isn't on a Sega Genesis, but the developer has insisted on developing this game with functionality so basic that anyone with low standards will be satisfied with this mindless dribble of a game. It literally takes less skill than Call of Duty takes, that's how bad this game is. And being restricted from installing it to your HD just forces the consumer to play this game behind a firewall of LAG AND LATENCY issues. Disgusting development. Poor execution. Morose implementation of consumer choices for better performance.<br />-NO ABILITY TO INSTALL THE GAME is TERRIBLE",1.0,Video_Games,0,33

"Excellent Record Washer - Gets the Dirt & Grime You Can't See: Heard about this for several years but thought my way of cleaning was good enough (soapy water & microfiber cloth).  Seems I was constantly having to clean the stylus after two or three songs and popping was irritating.  Most of my vinyl comes from small record stores where who knows how many people handled (and owned) them over the years. I purchased the Spin-Clean, followed the directions exactly and I was (and still am) very impressed with the results.  I have to say it really does provide a deep clean, which you can clearly see in the basin reservoir after about 10-15 records. The real results can be HEARD by playing a freshly cleaned album.  Noticeably less pops and I can play both sides straight through with nearly perfect sound quality.  This is very easy to use, and the included white cloths work great.  The solution dries quickly & evenly after wiping with no streaks.  Also, solution stays off of the center label because it follows the grooves while spinning.<br /><br />I have cleaned about 50 records so far in two separate sessions.  I only did about 25 per session and emptied & washed the reservoir each time.  Again, you can see the dirt in the tub due to the yellow color of the basin, so don't reuse in that case.  I suppose if you only clean three or four records you could save existing cleaning mix and reuse later but it only takes one cap of solution per mix, so why stretch it?<br /><br />The Value for Money is tough for me.  This is all plastic...well built (in USA), but plastic.  So, $75+ seems steep.  However, it's doing a great job and exceeds my expectations so I can't complain too loudly.  Definitely 5 stars for me overall and I recommend Spin-Clean.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

Not only does this perfectly fit the criteria for the assignment, it's an engaging, and interesting book! It's written from the first-person perspective of a baboon that lives in a baobab tree.

"The Inner Ring of American Athleticism: Once again we are exposed to the individuals who excel in athletics. But this time it is with people who you will only know as high achievers if you happen to belong to their chosen sports. In a way this is excellent and I don't doubt that there are some middle-agers who will take inspiration from the stories told here, and written in a Sunday-supplement style, therefore very accessible. But as a striving 60-year old I've a few quibbles. First, I am not at the top of my sport. A number of his athletes are people who excelled in college. How will I interpret their regimens with my own desire to simply be my best? This is summed-up by the Lance Armstrong effect. It is ridiculous for media to bombard all cycling with the WWLAD? Read Daniel Coyle's Lance Armstrong's War, in it Chris Carmichael tells us that his charge is exceptional from a genetic background. Great for him. But when I get on my cycle I want to craft my efforts for my body and mind, LA is not my template. Bergquist thus makes it difficult to glean from the articles, points of technical interest relevant to aspiring aging athletes. That's my second complaint, very difficult to utilise this information as more than a Parade-type profile. Third, stop lumping 40-year olds as 'Masters' athletes. This is a pathetic myth. If I were forty again I'd even dream of being a domestique in TDF.

"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. Pro Club claims to pre-shrink their shirts but they DO NOT. My husband is 6'7&#34; and as you can imagine, it's very hard to find shirts that are long enough to fit him. Amazon doesn't sell their shirts in Tall so I went to Pro Club's website and ordered them. When we washed (cold, delicate) and dried (low heat, delicate) the shirts the first time, they shrunk 2&#34; and were obviously too short. I called to get a refund, claiming their website is false when it says the shirts are pre-shrunk. I told them I wanted a refund for the shirts, the $15 shipping I paid to receive them, and the $15 shipping it would cost me to ship them back. They were very rude and claimed they had done nothing wrong. They said, obviously cotton shrinks and it's not their fault that they shrunk. It didn't matter to them that I only bought them because I was worried another brand would shrink but was guaranteed by their company that these would not shrink. Worst experience ever! It's so unfortunate that this Made in the USA company doesn't care about making a poor quality product or their reputation for advertising dishonestly.",1.0,Unknown,0,32

""Max On Life"" is safe ground.  No one is going to make fun of you for asking any question.  No one is going to whisper about you after the question is asked.

"Shapeless + cheap zippers: I was really excited about this bag, and a lot of the design aspects seem good. However it feels cheaply made - especially the zippers and lack of shape. It arrived crushed and would not stand up on its own. It sorta slumps over. The zippers are cheap - not YKK here, some Chinese junk. The zippers feel rough and are too small for this type of use. A serious boat tackle bag needs large, high quality zippers. I definitely feel that the minute any corrosion occurs (They are metal), a serious yank will break the zipper. The cheap zippers are amplified by the sloppy way the bag sits.<br /><br />Overall I like the design of this bag, but the construction is lacking. I guess you get what you pay for. Personally I'd pay more for a better bag. Put in good zippers and give it the ability to stand up. You’ll have a killer bag.",3.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,0,28

"150 Ideas for Window Treatments: If you would like an aesthetic overview of, and introduction to, window treatments, this book offers 150 examples.  What this book is great for is allowing you to see window treatments in actual attractive rooms from COUNTRY LIVING magazine and begin to formulate what styles, fabrics, detailing etc. you like.  Most of the styles here tend to be more informal as the rooms are often cottage, country, historical, farmhouse or casual styles.<br /><br />In team-teaching classes with an interior designer, the designer suggested in our classes that you really don't want your window treatments to dominate or be the focal point of the room. You don't want window treatments to scream at you when you enter the room. The treatments should complement the room, add softness perhaps, control light and offer privacy if needed.  You don't have to spend a lot on window treatments, especially in more casual rooms. And if you don't need privacy, bare windows can be attractive, too. Simple panels or roman shades, shutters or blinds often work the best. Those fancy, heavy drapes from the 1980's just aren't in style unless you're decorating a large formal Georgian-type house and want a historical style. Window treatments have lightened up if you study current magazines.  Less can be more in window treatments.  And you can combine window treatments: panels of fabric framing a window for softness and a shade for privacy. Not all curtains needs to be lined unless you're shutting out the light or have formal window treatments out of silk etc.  There weren't many lavish window treatments in this book for more formal rooms.<br /><br />Although this book features 150 different ways to dress your window, it suggests there are 4 basic styles which are featured here:<br /><br />* Curtains/Drapes--panels of fabrics that can be pulled horizontally across a pole.  Choice of headings include pleats, smocking, ties, tabs etc. and they can be on hooks, grommets or gathered on a pole.<br /><br />* Shades/blinds--open and close vertically.  They can be made out of fabric or another pliable material. Roman  shades are a neat, tailored shade which look great in many rooms.<br /><br />* Toppers--include valances, swags, scarves and cornices. Some of these can be casual wrapped around a pole or more formal and installed on a board.<br /><br />* Shutters--are hinged to the sides of the windows.<br /><br />What this book is great for is educating your eye as to what styles you like on different shaped windows and rooms.  See how they complement the architecture of the room and furnishings.  Do you like them hung above the window? Or near the ceiling to add height to a room?  Do you like inside mounts when you have attractive window trim? What about plain, patterned, striped or sheer fabric curtains?  You'll begin to identify what is pleasing to your eye and what you don't like in window treatments.<br /><br />This is a great beginning book to help you select window treatments you like that you can use in your own home which you can sew yourself, or buy through companies like Pottery Barn, Country Curtains, JC Penneys etc. or have custom made by a local curtain shop, tailor or Calico Corners.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Incident at Blood Pass  (1970) Contains no spoilers: This film is sure to appeal to fans of its famous principle actors Toshiro Mifune (Yojimbo), Katsu Shintaro (Zatoichi) and Yujiro Ishihara (Baby Cart series). The film was the last film in director Hiroshi Inagaki's long career. It will please the fans of the jidai geki (historical period drama) more than the those looking for chambara (sword fighting flick).<br /><br />The film is considered to be the last of four films featuring the 'yojimbo' (bodyguard) character or nameless samurai created for Mifune by Akira Kurosawa. The first two films, ""Yojimbo"" and ""Sanjuro"", are classics of the genre and have much more ambitious goals than the film we are considering here. The third film, the weakest offering amongst the the four, was ""Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo"" directed by Kihatchi Okamoto in which Toshiro Mifune does not really play the same character we are considering here and is a film which fits more comfortably into the chambara category.<br /><br />This film feels much like an extention of the Japanese television 'period drama' of its day which I confess to being somewhat partial to. It is elevated by the star studded cast and their performances however it is limited by a tendency at times toward melodrama, the use of stock genre character types and what appears to be a hastily tacked on ending to provide resolution to one of the major narrative threads. It is the last element which is the most unsatisfactory and the film would probably have been better served without tying up this thread at all rather than handling it in a manner which makes it appear to be a cursory afterthought.<br /><br />Still the film does have much which will satisfy fans of the genre with good performances, an interesting if complex interplay of events and an examination of human behaviour when looking at individuals placed in a high pressure situation. I have heard the film compared to Archie Mayo's ""The Petrified Forest"" with Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart. This is an apt comparison from the standpoint of the situation which the characters find themselves in.<br /><br />For those solely interesting in the action elements: The film does have two interesting scenes of sword play, the first beautiful and brief, the second longer and exciting if somewhat less beautifully choreographed. It also features a ham handed fist fight near the beginning of the film which would make John Wayne appear a well schooled boxer by comparison.<br /><br />But really for those looking for a blood and guts samurai flick you would be much better served by picking up something like ""Sword of Doom"" or something from the Zatoichi series. This is a film for fans of genre, looking for a rather standard period drama elevated by good performances by Mifune and Katsu.",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Two player competitive Tetris...with but one strategy.: I was really looking forward to this game simply because Uwe Rosenberg is one of, if not my favorite designer.<br /><br />This is a really simple two-player only game of competitive Tetris.  In this game players will take turns purchasing one of 3 available tiles, all the tiles are laid out at the beginning of the game in a large circle and you can purchase one of the 3 tiles ahead of a pawn placed in this circle.  The tiles all have two costs on them, one in buttons, which is both a form of currency and your victory points at game end, and the other in time.  The tiles are different shapes and sizes and players are trying to fill in as much of their 9x9 grid with these tiles as possible.  Players also progress along a time track and whoever is at the back of the track gets to take a turn, much like in Glen More.  When both players reach the end of the time track the final scores are a player's buttons minus 2x the number of their empty spaces.<br /><br />There are two ways to get buttons in this game.  One is to forgo purchasing a tile and move your piece to exactly one space ahead of your opponent on the time track getting 1 button for each space moved.  This is incredibly inefficient.  The other way is by passing &#34;income&#34; spaces that give you one button for every button on tiles you've placed.  Some of the tiles have buttons on them.<br /><br />That's my main gripe with the game, the tiles with buttons on them are so much more  valuable than any of the other tiles.  If you can get a tile with buttons on it, you need to.  This, first of all, needs to be told to new players (it wasn't to me and I lost 40-0) but even then it is the only real strategy.  And sometimes just dumb luck can screw you here.  If none of the next 3 tiles has buttons on it you are stuck either possibly making one available for purchase by your opponent or losing ground by not taking a meaningful turn.  Those tiles just dictate too much of the game.<br /><br />However, the rest of the game is an enjoyable puzzle and it plays really quickly.  Not bad for an occasional play but still one of my least favorite Rosenberg games.",3.0,Toys_and_Games,0,31

"Setup is terrible.  They make it overly difficult.: I just got my whistle.  Trying to set it up got me inventing new cuss words.  The app is the problem so far - they put a large ""NEXT"" button on the screen of my cellphone which covers the area of the screen where it shows what I'm typing, so basically I'm typing blind.  This is a problem when entering my router's password.  My fat fingers don't always hit the key I'm aiming for.  Then, going back to redo this step, I go back a couple of screens and it has to find my whistle again, which takes about 5 times longer than the first time it found it!<br />  But editing the map is the worst!  You should be able to do this on your PC.  On your phone it is extremely difficult.  My property is 53 acres, but I couldn't seem to get the safe area squeezed down that small.  I fussed and fussed, the dog staring at me with her ""It's time to take a walk"" look.  Eventually, my clumsy figures inadvertently changed the safe area map from a rectangle to a triangle and the DONE area of the screen!  I hope I can come back and correct this later.  I spent over an hour fussing with this.  I could rant some more, but I'd rather take the dog for our morning walk!",2.0,Unknown,0,32

"Majorly Different from the Movie: I gave it five stars because the book looked fresh. But I can see why everyone liked the movie more than the book. But here's the thing, it's nice to read about how Mima Kirigoe's world was before the 90s film came out.<br /><br />Okay so MAJOR SPOILERS!!<br /><br />In this light novel, Mima is still a pop idol but she had always carried herself in a traditional way and was always kindhearted to her fans and her team, unlike her snooty rival Eri Ochiai. But she felt like she needed to shed her image as an innocent, childlike pop idol to show the world that she was not a kid anymore. Much to the displeasure of her ""Darling Rose"". He kept sending her letters and calling her phone begging her  ""Please don't change, stay the innocent Charming Rose you are"" ""I'm your biggest fan"" and all that jazz.<br /><br />Rumi is supportive of Mima's decision to be a sexier pop idol, unlike the movie where she's against the idea of her leaving CHAM to become an actress.<br /><br />Mr. Tadakoro, Rumi, and Murano were very protective of Mima when they found out about that obsessed creep who kept stalking her. But in the movie, Mima started getting harassing letters after she quit singing. And everyone just kept sweeping it under the rug as if nothing happened.<br /><br />Murano, the Photographer, is actually a nice and charming guy and not a total pervert like in the movie. He helped Rumi and Mr. Tadakoro rescue Mima from that crazy man, Me-Mania.<br /><br />Eri Ochiai wasn't Mima's co-star and a very nice lady in the novel. She was snobby, manipulative, and demanding toward everyone including Mima. Eri would do anything to remain in the spotlight even if it meant trying to ruin Mima's image by hiring a shady reporter, Sakuragi to spy on her and catch her with her new date. But unfortunately for her, she met her untimely end at the hands of Me-Mania<br /><br />Me-Mania/Mamoru Chida didn't have a name in the book. He was always called ""That Man"". He's a big fan of Mima Krirgoe...well too much of a fan. He has an unhealthy obsession with Mima and other Pop Idols and is a wanted criminal. He killed a little girl and took the skin off her leg, He even killed Eri Ochiai and took the skin off her face, and he tried to kill Mima as well. The guy's a creep, he doesn't even bathe, and he has a huge collection of VHS tapes from the other Idols even Mima and Eri, and he has risque photo books of certain pop idols and he pleasures himself to them (except Mima of course because of her purity as an idol, which he's heavily devoted to). He's more disturbing in the book than in the movie.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book. I believe both the book and the movie gave these characters fleshed-out personalities and uniquely showed the dark side of the entertainment industry, what really goes on as soon as curtains close. I've said it before and I'll say it again, It's not easy being a pop idol in the Blue-niverse! However, If I have to between the book and the movie, it would be the movie because it's one of my favorite films and it's unforgettable and way ahead of its time. To this day!",5.0,Books,1,7

The first time I cleaned the diaper out by hand and then machine washed it and it still had &#34;evidence&#34; stuck in the stitching and mesh lining and smelled bad. After a second hand wash I was willing to give it another shot. The second time she soiled this diaper I threw them both out on the spot!

"Excelllent documentary: I found this movie an eye opener, if a bit melodramatic, the facts are nevertheless accurate. It is a fact that the ""Democratic Socialists"" have burrowed deep into Democratic Party, are receiving advice from European Communists, and  gradually subverting the Democratic Party, pushing it further and further left.<br />The founders of Black Lives Matter admit they are ""trained Marxists."" If you donate to BLM the site directs you to ""Act Blue,' the Democratic fund raising site. No wonder Democratic candidates promise the uproar will continue. All the riots and burning buildings are great fund raisers for the DNC.<br /><br />Another example of our vulnerability; a Chinese national named Yu Ben Meng.  Despite being a Chinese national and a member of China's top spy organization, he's the chief investment officer for CALPERS, the largest public pension fund in the U.S.  Meng was recruited by China's spy agency, the Thousand Talent Program. Meng has used this position to invest in Chinese companies that build up their military and put our country at risk.<br />Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib have participated in raising money for Hamas, a known terrrorist organization. Hamas has donated large sums to many Democratic politicians.<br />If you want a less melodramatic analysis of our national security, order Andrew McCarthy's book, ""The Grand Jihad.""McCarthy is the former US Attorney who convicted the Blind Sheikh, mastermind of the 1993 WTC bombing. It describes the symbiotic relationship of radical Islam and the Left, and how they operate to fragment Western Society. A prime example is Somali immigrant, Ilhan Omar, an Islamist and socialist who hates our country and supports Al Shabaab.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"3 Okay Stars.: This isn't my first Adriana Locke book. I normally LOVE her books. This one I didn't. Probably this is one of those times that the book ""just wasn't for me."" That happens sometimes. I don't like to DNF a book, so I hung in there and kept reading, slowly and between other books. The book just didn't grab me immediately, making it hard for me to grab onto something that would draw my attention and keep me reading. It was well-written, the characters were good, the storyline started well. Then it kind of veered off in different directions. Okay, that was fine, but for me, it tended to drag on and on and on. I felt it could have moved along a bit faster, but like I said, that's probably just me, judging by the fantastic reviews I've seen for this book. Ultimately, I finished it. The book had lots of ""emotional"" times and lots of funny times too. I can't rave about it. For me it was just okay. Read the blurb and give it a go if it sounds like your kind of book.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

The first time I used one on the metal straw my wife uses for her smoothies, it was amazing (disgusting) the amount of &#34;stuff&#34; which came out from the inside of the straw. The only issue is that the metal wire is twisted to the top, so there isn't any brush at the every end. When I wanted to use the end to clean a tight space, it wouldn't work.

"Could be the perfect camera but is not...: 1) GENERAL THOUGHTS about Canon old SLR cameras and ""CANON SX 120 IS"" digital camera<br /><br />Since 1973, when I bought my first Canon 814 super 8 movie camera, I have always been loyal to the brand and I currently have two super 8 cameras (Canon 1040 silent and 1014 XLS sound) that I'm saving for some savvy collector who would like to buy them, plus several SLR: a New F1 with AE finder, two A1 with winders and one outstanding T90, with a set of FD Canon lenses ranging from an outstanding 20 mm f2.8 to an excellent 85 mm f1.8, including a rare FD 50 mm f1.4 and a little wonder called ""35 mm Tilt and Shift"" (all manual) for architecture shots.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have never purchased a digital SLR because Canon technicians were not smart enough (or honest enough...) to offer an adapter allowing me to use (even manually!) my excellent FD lenses that I refuse to throw away in order to buy the new autofocus ones, especially the 35 TS for which I paid more than $700 thirty years ago!  If they had made this adapter, I would have already purchased at least two digital SLR cameras.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I did buy a digital A85 several years ago that I still have and which makes excellent pictures.<br /><br />A year ago, in March 2010, I bought my second digital Canon camera: the ""SX 120 IS"" from Office Depot because I had a $60 reward card from them and because they also accepted a $25 coupon, which lowered the price to a mere $128 with tax out of my pocket.  After taking a few pictures along the beach, I packed it and returned it for a full refund, except for the $25 coupon that I lost.<br /><br />2) THE ALMOST PERFECT ""CANON SX 120 IS"" DIGITAL CAMERA<br /><br />This could be the perfect camera... IF it had a viewfinder!  Unfortunately, whoever designed this (would be wonderful) camera, decided NOT to put a viewfinder, which killed the sale!<br /><br />It is as small as my old A85, it therefore fits in a shirt's pocket, and has the same familiar selector on top allowing you to choose between AV (Aperture Value) if you want to work on aperture priority, TV (Time Value) if you prefer to select your speed and let the camera choose the aperture, and even a manual mode.  In addition, it also has several all automatic point-and-shoot modes that I always ignore!<br /><br />On the other hand, it works on AA batteries that you may find anywhere.  Therefore, you will never have to stop shooting when your rechargeable battery runs dead in the middle of the jungle: all you need is a pair of fresh alkaline batteries that won't dig a hole in your pocket because of their weight!<br /><br />Finally, the 10X optical zoom (equivalent to a 36 --> 360 mm on a 24 X 36 SLR format) is far more than the mere 3X of my A85.<br /><br />So why did I return it after taking a few excellent pictures along the beach?<br /><br />Simply because I was shooting blindly, due to the fact that it has no viewfinder and it is impossible to compose a picture with the screen under direct bright sunlight, as we have in our sunny Miami Beach!  As I said, the absence of viewfinder killed the sale!<br /><br />Last December, I bought the ""CANON SX 20 IS"" which also works on alkaline batteries, has a 20X optical zoom and, most of all, a viewfinder, but it is almost twice as thick as the ""SX 120 IS"" and it is therefore far from fitting in my shirt pocket.  I have not tested it yet because I have been too busy with my last academic book about French dramatist Jean Anouilh (550 pages in French that will soon be listed on Amazon) but I expect to do it next month during my trips to Seattle, Las Vegas and Montevideo.  A detailed review will follow most probably by the end of the year.<br /><br />3) CONCLUSION<br /><br />IF I were still living in Paris, France, with a handful of sunny days per year, I might have kept this very good and handy camera.  But since I now live in Sunny Miami Beach, it is totally useless for me without a viewfinder because it is absolutely impossible to compose the picture on the screen under bright sunlight.  True, you could shoot blindfolded and spend several hours later reframing each shot in the computer.  But ever since I started taking pictures of landscapes and architecture in the 1960s, I never point and shoot; I think, frame and reframe before pressing the button.  This was a must when you had to pay a fortune to buy and process color slides before the digital waste era!<br /><br />Now, if you can afford to pay a beautiful secretary to stand behind you with a huge black umbrella and shade your screen while you frame, this might be a good option.  But since I'm just a French professor working almost for free at FIU, this solution is out of question for me!",3.0,Electronics,0,12

"I love Alpine Products But...: I love Alpine products I have had 4 head units in various cars over the years.  I was excited to get this HD tuner because several stations in the area offer HD broadcasts.  The great thing about the HD is that you usually get to see the artists name, the song title and the album on the display as it is playing.  I like this feature because if I like what I hear then I can make a note of it for future reference.  Not all stations offer this feature unfortunately.<br /><br />The problem with my unit is that it worked for several weeks but then it stopped updating the songs.  When I turn it on it will give me the current song but when the song changes the first song played stays on the display.  So I called Alpine and the were very helpful.  The problem it seems is that my head unit is several years old and the HD tuner is new.  The head unit needs an update.  So according to the person I spoke with I have to pull my head unit and ship it back to Alpine.  The will update the software and return it to me for free.  All well and good however they are on the west coast and I am on the east coast.  It is a 5 day ship time each way and they will take 2-3 days to do the update.  So I am looking at, best case, being with out my head unit (no music or podcasts) for two weeks minimum.  It really is not worth all that to me and is kind of disappointing.<br /><br />What I do not understand is why, with technology today, I cannot download the update myself on my computer and then install it in my head unit (it has a USB connection).  Time to update guys!",3.0,Electronics,0,12

"First rate serving. Even when cold.: Joe Abercrombie’s Best Served Cold is even darker and more sinister than the First Law trilogy. But, despite some flaws in the (predictable) plot and in the depth of the characters, not to mention some un-mentionable sex scenes, I enjoyed this single volume well enough to recommend it to readers of the First Law trilogy. The setting is exactly the same as the world in the First Law trilogy, some secondary characters being propelled to the front stage, while other major characters become accessories to the story.<br /><br />Although this will sound paradoxical to any reader of the book, Best Served Cold somehow feels more “homely”  (than the First Law trilogy) in that the plot follows a single character, Monza, in her senseless quest for revenge. Once again, there is no “good guy” in the novel and every character enjoys some dark side. Monza builds up a motley group of mercenaries to carry out her revenge and most of them end up in dire circumstances. Once again, Abercrombie is able to forge a very unforgiving universe with characters that are far from flawless but attractive nonetheless. The whole story shows a world on the brink of a barbaric collapse where mercenaries keep switching sides, cities are looted and re-looted, local heads are repeatedly assassinated, and harvests destroyed… This is definitely a mature book, to keep away from young adults attracted by heroic fantasy. but the unravelling of the story is (mostly) fast paced enough to make reading the book compelling and above all enjoyable. (Okay, I must add that the happy ending could and should have been avoided, but then no major character would have been left alive by the end of the book! And the supernatural natures of the characters Shenkt and Ishri leave a large part unexplained…)",5.0,Books,1,7

"Doesn't Have the Magic: There was a time, back in the late '60's and early '70's, when Roger Zelazny was my favorite author, and I still regard Lord of Light, Isle of the Dead and many of his short stories to be among the best things science fiction has every produced. This book, unfortunately, doesn't have the magic. Zelazny was once quoted as saying that he tended to write all of his books from his weaknesses. I never, frankly, quite understood what he meant by that, but what I think he meant is that by deliberately confronting his weaknesses, he could turn them into strengths. No matter--this book highlights Zelazny's weaknesses. First of all, there is rarely a lot of character development in a Zelazny novel. His heroes come onto the stage fully formed, mature, usually possessing god-like powers. Their adventures are compelling, but at the end of them, the hero is usually not too different than from when he started. Second, the baroque nature of the language can be jarring. This usually works in science fiction and fantasy, as it highlights the alien and baroque nature of the fictional universe. In the Dead Man's Brother, it's only jarring. This book is a competent and basically pedestrian mystery. The hero, Ovid Wiley, is a former art thief turned gallery owner. He is smart, competent, cynical and does not have a lot of empathy. He doesn't inspire a great deal of sympathy. The tension level is consequently reduced. One minor, and completely unnecessary sub-plot, has Ovid being informed by a CIA physician that he may (or may not) have a gene for congenital luck. No matter what deathly scrape he gets into, something always happens to bail him out. Hard once again, to worry too much about a hero who is always going to get lucky, and indeed, Ovid is incredibly lucky, surviving narrow escape after narrow escape in a way that is not in the slightest made more believable by this convenient and annoying plot device. In the end, our hero returns to his life little changed from his adventures, and I, to be honest, did not much care.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Problems which should be resolved by the manufacturer --: UPDATE: 1/19/2018 --<br /><br />I thought this case was a single layer.  Now, little more than a month after purchase, the outer &#34;layer&#34; is separating from the underlying &#34;layer&#34;.<br /><br />Review reduced one star.  I'm feeling kind.<br />______________<br /><br />I have yet to find any of these cases satisfactory in all respects, regardless manufacturer.  In one instance, one part is perfect, but a main feature doesn't live up to the claims for it.  In another a main feature is as claimed, but something else is a problem.<br /><br />In this instance it's the overlap over and beyond the bezel -- the overlap really doesn't need to be as wide as it is.  And the cutout at the top exposing the camera should simply be cut straight across.<br /><br />Another problem, which contributes to that problem, is the stiffness of the material, which results in the Kindle not fitting all the way into the case.  It's not off by much at all, but enough to cause the case on one side to overreach the bezel onto/over the screen itself and obscure what is showing on the screen.<br /><br />In addition, the extent of the overlap adds shadow around the inner edges, increasing the difficulty of seeing the text and controls on the edge/s of the screen.<br /><br />Though the material is rather stiff, I'm hoping it will break in, and those problems resolve themselves.  If not, I consider trimming it somehow: the overlap over the bezel really doesn't need to be so wide -- perhaps an 1/8&#34; less on the sides, and cut straight across the top instead of having the cut-out, would improve it.<br /><br />A replacement wouldn't cure those problems, unless the design were changed along the lines suggested.  And a refund . . . as said, none of these cases are entirely satisfactory, regardless manufacturer, so a refund would mean buying a different product with different problems.<br /><br />Last but not least: There are no instructions for applying the screen saver.",2.0,Electronics,0,12

"Works great but a little hard to push on carpet: Assembly was brief using the small manual supplied. I want to mention that after you complete assembly, make sure to get familiar with all the vacuum parts and what each one does. By doing this you can quickly understand how to clean the canister and the location of all the filters that will at some point need to be cleaned or washed, as well as using the auto button, and what to do in case of a blockage. The next important item is the auto button and understanding its functions.  The first time you turn on the vacuum you will want to calibrate the motor.  It’s a simple procedure and works best on a hard floor.  Place the brush upright and turn on the vacuum. Make sure the brush on button on the handle is pressed on. Then push the lighted auto button and hold for 5 seconds and the blue lights will flash then turn solid after 10 seconds. Calibration is complete and turn off the vacuum and back on again when ready to use.  What the calibration does is adjust the vacuum strength on a surface.  Okay, some of the nice features I like about this machine is the handle can clean in tight places and the extension height is adjustable. You can turn the brush rotation on and off.  It is a handy feature if you are cleaning a heavy shag type rug and don't want to snag it.  Another feature I like is its LONG 28 foot retractable cord. Notice that when the cord is fully pulled out it has a yellow and red marking so not to pull the cord past them. I also like that the motor is quiet compared to uprights.<br /><br />Overall I like this machine. It has good suction. The floor rotation brush has bright lights that shine toward the floor so you can see even the smallest crumb. The hose is also pretty long and keeps the canister/motor far enough away.  Also the handle and extension parts snap to a tight fit so not much air is allowed to escape. There is one slide switch under the top of the handle that opens and closes. I don't understand why someone would open it as some suction would escape. The manual says nothing on why it’s there. For now I will keep it closed until I find out otherwise. Cleaning the bagless canister is easy. Bissell does give an extra foam filter when needed but they can be washed and dried for 24 hours many times before replacing.<br /><br />I would like to see is if Bissell will make a small rotation brush to fit this vacuum for sofas and chairs.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Good encouragement/reminders: The book offers little in terms of ground that hasn't been covered before.  Work hard.  Persevere.  Empower employees.  Set measurable goals.  Get feedback.  Hold others accountable. Be approachable.  Be resilient. Dream big.  Apart from a lack of new information, I'm just not sure how Biblically accurate this book is. (I mention this because the book is put out by a Christian publishing house.)  For example:<br /><br />Book: ""Each of us is in control of our own journey.  Deciding what we want and how to get there."" - p. 98<br /><br />Bible: ""In his heart a man plans his course, but the Lord determines his steps."" - Proverbs 16:9<br /><br />Apart from not exactly squaring with the Bible, there is an overall level of self-determinism in here that books such as ""Outliers"" by Malcolm Gladwell make a compelling argument against.  Just how much are we in control over what happens to us?  A scripture in the book of Ecclesiastes puts it this way, ""The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.""  There is something to be said for being in the right place at the right time.  This book leans toward the side that a person can make anything happen if they work hard enough.  This sounds nice, but try telling that to someone who was born a midget but really wants to play in the NBA.<br /><br />The book does offer some helpful tips and words of inspiration.  There are continual challenges to not get stuck in old mindsets.  There are charges to break free from self-imposed limitations.  There is encouragement to go for it all.  This is good and commendable.  Sometimes, though, it blurs into the message ""get more and you will be happy"".  On the contrary, it is better to have one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil (Ecclesiastes 4:6).  Godliness with contentment is great gain (1 Timothy 6:6).<br /><br />Another thing that bugged me about this book was how the author rarely goes into any personal flaws or shortcomings.  Maybe he focused a little too much on his career at the expense of his family.  Maybe he has had to deal with a lot of pride as a result of all of his accomplishments.  I'm sure there is something he currently struggles with.  Letting us in on this would help us to see him as less of a success machine and more of a human being.  I would have an easier time relating.  When he does reveal any personal struggles, he quickly discusses how he remedied the situation.<br /><br />Here is an example of how he comes off looking like a model of perfection:<br /><br />""On some days I've shaken as many as one thousand hands (and yes, my hand hurt that night). Long ago I lost count of how many people told me, ""No executive has ever come down here and shaken my hand.""  Just as important, I always leave time for dialogue after I speak."" (p. 147)<br /><br />I know that he is wanting to share his advice in order to help others achieve a greater measure of success.  Still, sections like the one above came off as self-congratulatory.<br /><br />Other chapters felt like they could have been titled, ""How to manipulate your employees as much as possible for personal gain.""  I am no advocate for employees slacking off, but it is possible for things to go to the opposite extreme.  In fairness to AT&T, I have no idea how well or poorly they treat their employees.<br /><br />Though I have been piling on, there were many things I liked about this book.  The focus on character and integrity was great.  The book was clear and easy to read. The summaries at the end of each chapter were helpful.  I also enjoyed the parts where de la Vega went into strategy (e.g. how he handled the merger, how he delegates authority and what changes were put in place for more effective marketing).  My favorite part of the book was in the initial chapter where de la Vega describes his immigration experience.  This part was fascinating and I was left wanting for more.<br /><br />I have no doubt that de la Vega excels at what he does.  He clearly cares very much about his company and takes great pride in its success.  In the process of describing how he overcome so many obstacles, the author shares concepts in order to benefit the reader.  I just didn't encounter as many new concepts as I would have liked.  Nevertheless, sometimes it is good to be reminded.<br /><br />This book was provided for review by Thomas Nelson.",3.0,Books,0,7

It's a shame that the sellers aren't selling the patch panel with the deeper bracket - in packages of even just 10, the 89U is only 11 dollars, or about a dollar a bracket.

"Exactly what I wanted: This is a great desk. I needed something fairly affordable during this 'work-from-home' era, but wanted something affordable and which fit stylistically with my older home. Everything else I looked at had very mixed reviews, was out of stock, and was made of 'manufactured' wood. This desk is real hardwood - unusual at the &lt;$1000 price point, much less the &lt;$500 category. The desktop comes pre-assembled, including the keyboard tray/top drawer. Hardware is very solid. The hardware for the tray face locks in place so it can be used as a drawer if you don't need to use it as a tray (perhaps between pandemic flare-ups). It assembled very easily, although there were two of us which helped since it's fairly heavy and needs to be flipped. The external packaging was banged up a bit in transit, but packing was very thorough, and nothing affected the desk. It arrived faster than promised. All in all, I'm very pleased with this quality product, as well as the delivery process.",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18
"Selected tracks from 1968 through 1971: All of the tracks on this out-of-print album were recorded for the  MPS/BASF label between 1968 and 1971. What I love about this album is it's post Peterson/Brown/Thigpen. While I think that line-up was arguably the best incarnation of the trio (part of the time I think the Peterson/Ellis/Brown one was), the musicians on these tracks are superb.<br /><br />One thing is sure, Peterson had a knack for attracting the best musicians, and especially bassists and guitarists. He is reunited with Herb Ellis on two tracks and Ray Brown on one. In addition, there is yet another collaboration between him and Milt Jackson who is given a lot more latitude that John Lewis gave him in the Modern Jazz Quartet.<br /><br />This page does not have a track list at the time of this review so forgive me for cluttering this review with one, but I think it's important:<br /><br />A1  Naptown Blues  5:20<br />A2  Green Dolphin Street  6:18<br />A3  Dream Of You  4:17<br />A4  In A Mellotone  5:58<br />B1  Blues For H.G.  6:10<br />B2  Give Me The Simple Life  3:58<br />B3  Greensleeves  4:30<br />B4  Blues For Martha  5:10<br /><br />Sadly there are no sound samples, but the copy that I have has a wonderful mix, that is even across the frequency spectrum. Remember, these are musicians who took care of their own dynamics, so it does not sound like some bored engineer ran amok. Each track is as if you were in a small club, which is yet another reason to grab this.<br /><br />Here are the dates and musicians for each track:<br />A1 and B1 were recorded in the Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer Studio in Villingen Germany on November 5 and 6, 1969. They feature Peterson accompanied by Herb Ellis on guitar and backed by Sam Jones on bass and Bobby Durham on drums.<br /><br />A2 and A4 were recorded in the same studio during an unspecified date in  April, 1968. Peterson is backed by Sam Jones on bass and Bobby Durham on drums.<br /><br />A3 was recorded in the same studio during July, 1971. This track features Peterson accompanied by Milt Jackson on vibraphone and backed by Ray Brown on bass and Louis Hayes on drums.<br /><br />B2 was recorded at the same studio during a set of sessions that spanned November 10 through 13, 1970. This track features Peterson solo.<br /><br />B3 and B4 are from the same November 10 through 13, 1970 sessions cited above. These tracks feature Peterson backed by Jiri Mraz on bass and Ray Price on drums.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Despite being marketed with the others, DOES NOT HAVE PERSONAL FORMS: The way this is marketed on the Amazon site is somewhere between confusing and disingenuous - it is listed alongside all 4 other versions, all of which have the personal tax forms that I'm sure draw 99.9% of shoppers to this page.  This version doesn't have any of the personal forms (e.g. no 1040) also doesn't include a free State e-file.<br /><br />So, just a note to be careful - if you're in a rush and (like me) assume the most expensive one will also include what the less expensive versions do - it does not. This is very clear on the TurboTax website, now that I have gone and looked at it - on that site, they only include the 4 personal versions on their comparison page, and you have to click elsewhere to get to the business one.

"Fell Short of Expectations, Wobbly where Base meets Bassinet: There is a lot of hype around this bassinest, and I personally found it didn't live up to it's cost. By the time my daughter was 15 pounds she seemed genuinely uncomfortable by it's thinness and size; we ended up moving her to her full size crib and she slept a lot better. She would scratch the mesh sides and it drove me bonkers! The base is incredibly sturdy; however, the bassinet piece itself was wobbly for us. It also squeaked sometimes when she would kick around, which was a bit annoying. The controls on the side seemed cool, but the vibration was loud as it struck up against the side part of the bassinet bottom, we rarely used it, just didn't seem like it did much besides make noise. The light also was sort of pointless and not really helpful. It also came with some music which was nice, and a timer which I never used since we used an app for tracking breastfeeding. I came to hate the swiveling, honestly. It seemed like it just always was in the way and would sometimes wake her up if I had to move it while she was sleeping. I definitely liked that it rose to the height of our high bed, it was very nice having her right at eye level with me. It was also nice how it bent down so you could gently place her in and get her out. Maybe my baby was just temperamental, she just didn't like this thing. All-in-all I don't think this bassinet is worth the cost. I had really high expectations for it and ultimately they fell short.<br /><br />Oh, also, get some extra sheets off Amazon, it was nice having real sheets to put on it, it doesn't come with anything besides a mattress cover (which is mostly water resistant but still, the sheets are a good thing to have on hand for real messes.)",2.0,Unknown,0,32

Maybe had 10-20 hours at most on the engine.  It would not start last November when I started it up to blow some leave.  Just raked them and ordered new carburetor (after disassembling and inspecting the old one), bought a new spark plug, checked the fuel filter and the kill switch.  Could not for the life of me figure out why I could not get the unit to start.  Bought a spark tester and tested for spark.  Finally this month I took it to a repair guy and he disassembled it and determined that it was not making compression.  The unit was shot.  The engine had failed after no more than 20 hours of operation over 1 year 4 months.  I would not buy this unit again.  I have been reviewing new blowers and it looks like all of them have problems in the area of reliability by the number of reviews that have 1 out of 5.  Engines are easy but they are not reliable when corners are cut or they are cheaply made.  Nothing is well built anymore!  Especially these blowers.",1.0,Unknown,0,32

"Cheaply made: I loved the look of this and it was just what I was looking for but I think that this one should be much cheaper since it is not made very well.

There are a LOT of wires sticking out and I cut mu finger on one of them while I was putting it together. I had to go back over it with some needle nosed pliers to try and bend the wires back in. I'm only keeping it because I need it for someone coming to stay at my house to put belongings in that she can reach easily and move around easily. OH, the wheels squeak terribly too.

"Functional but Cheap: The pink in the stock photo is not quite the same color as it is in person, but I like the way in looks in person much better. Functionality wise, this case does what it claims, but it feels a bit cheap. The carrying handle seems like there is only a matter of time before it rips off. Aside from the cheap feel of this case, I do think that my Switch is protected. The Nintendo AC adapter just barely fits in the pocket of this case. The top of the case doesn't completely close without using some pressure. (When the charger is not in it, the case closes without any pressure.) It is a little concerning because I don't want there to be too much pressure on my Switch inside the case, but I think it will be okay.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"Set me on a path to a life changing transformation: At first glance, this book looks like it is for the relatively fit and the &#34;skinny fat&#34; to become more elite in their fitness level. I was not anywhere near that level (I was very obese and weak), but I needed to do something different. I set out to learn about weightlifting, and I am glad I found this book as my guide. The information was logical and reasonable -- no quick  fixes, rather it was a systemic way to &#34;do the work.&#34; Initially I started out too weak to do the big compound exercises that he recommends and too intimated to work out in the free weights area anyways. So I started (contrary to the author's recommendation) doing similar exercises on the machines, but making sure to follow his process and philosophy. The physical changes I have made are not dramatic, but they do amount to good, solid progress. It's been about 1-1/2 years. I have lost 65 lbs. I have gone from struggling with the 30 lbs minimum weight on a chest press machine to comfortably bench pressing 65 lbs, and I have built up the necessary strength and flexibility in my hamstrings to deadlift ... And the mental changes that come with the increased capabilities have made me a whole new me! I have recommended this book many times, and expect to continue to do so.",5.0,Books,1,7

The screws for the battery compartment did not come out easily and stripped as I had to open and close it twice because it did not work initially.

Various mishaps occur, but the resourceful Bear Flatters manage to come through.<br />The only other &#34;journal&#34; book I can think of that's written from a male POV is the Diary or Adrian Mole (I do find it interesting that both of these books were written by women).  It's not too badly dated (this was published in 1988), but some things would not be issues with modern technology. However, the lady who runs the motel is a firm believer in gender roles, so has all of the girls quilt, etc.<br />This is a quick and fun read.<br />Overall a good book, and Jake a folksy and charming narrator.",3.0,Books,0,7

"5 stars for Whiskey Neat: Whiskey Neat by Lani Lynn Vale is the story of Griffin, a Texas Ranger and member of the Uncertain Saints MC. He is a man on the verge of deciding whether he can live in the gray area of right and wrong rather than just black and white. He meets Lenore, the owner of a sex toy shop when he walks into her shop to &#34;buy batteries.&#34; I'm not so sure that he hadn't seen her before but for the sake of the book, let's say this is their first interaction.<br /><br />They are a hit by a case of lust and Griffin begins making late night visits to Lenore...and they are hot. I don't think that Griffin planned on Lenore coming into his life at all. He is a man set on revenge and he knows if he's not careful, she will become a casualty. He also knows that he might one day step outside the law and he wants to shield her from that as well.<br /><br />Honestly, Griffin scared me a little bit.ok a lot. I can't even begin to understand the trauma he went through to get to the point where he was at, but I felt that he should have taken a step back from his job. No matter what, I don't feel it's appropriate to use your badge to mete out vigilante justice...even if it is deserved.<br /><br />I loved the story of Whiskey Neat. I think Lani did a super job tying in the name of the town and the MC's name with &#34;unecertainess&#34; the character is feeling about his life, his job, etc. I'm looking forward to finding out more about this series and the characters...especially Wolfe...his story is one I know is going to pull at my heart.<br /><br />Congratulations Ms. Vale on another great read!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

So I've been drinking chai since before it became a fad here in the US, when my mom would make homemade chai with fresh ginger and mint leaves every morning. I've also had chai off the streets of Delhi, Banaras, etc. And now that I am in college, I have to say this almost brought tears to my eyes cause it reminded me of home!<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Honestly, didn't expect a powder product to taste this good. Nothing can beat fresh homemade of course, but this still really does hit the spot! I did add a little bit of sugar alongside side this into my milk because I prefer my chai really sweet. It was creamy and I could really taste the spices which leave a nice aftertaste after you gulp down the drink. Love!!!<br /><br />AMOUNT OF PRODUCT:<br />I read some people had complaints about the container being half empty, or 2/3rds full, so I was worried when I opened the safety seal, but it was pretty full, I'd say 4/5ths full which is really decent. I suppose I got lucky? Regardless, there is so much product that it will last me probably 2-3 months, maybe more.

Excellent.: I have had nothing but a great experience with this this sawzall since the time I bought it.  I will be very pleased if it stands the test of time and keeps working as nicely as it does now.  That 5 year warranty also gives me some peace of mind.  It may be a little pricy but in my opinion it is worth is.

The space for installation was a bit tight, which is an unfortunate characteristic of the Odyssey, and I ended up dropping one of the LED brackets into an inaccessible part of the engine compartment.  When I contacted the vendor to ask how I could obtain a replacement, they sent me a complete spare, which is first-rate customer service in my book since the fault was my clumsiness rather than any fault of the product.  Once installed, the lights were significantly brighter then the legacy bulbs (which makes sense comparing 8000 lumens to 4000), and since these are LED's hopefully my days of servicing the headlights (due to burnt filaments) are behind me!",5.0,Automotive,1,4

In reading all three books, she gives an excellent view of her personal life, her feelings about her employers (or &#34;them&#34; as she says), and the daily events that result in scandals that could only happen in the pre-World War era.

"The perfect finale and HEA for Bash + Kieran!: Sexy. Swoony. Sweet. Hot. Loving. Funny. Wonderful. So many words to describe Bash and Kieran’s story and none of them are exactly right. I loved this trilogy by Ella Frank and Brooke Blaine so much - it was unexpected but made me laugh, smile, cry and fall in love with these two characters even more with each new book.<br /><br />Bash and Kieran had to make a big decision in this book and I was so curious to see where they would go with it. There wasn’t a wrong choice to make, but someone’s life was going to change completely once they did. I loved seeing them both together again in Chicago and in South Haven - their connection is so genuine and electric that you can feel it coming off the page. Even though things happened between them quickly, they developed such an intense relationship that only continues to grow as they experience more and more together. Things between them are just easy, like they’ve always been together, supporting each other and encouraging them to be the best version of themselves they can be. They’re so sexy, steamy and sweet together that I can’t get enough!<br /><br />I seriously loved all of the character crossovers coming together - seeing part of the Chicagoverse and South Haven finally meet and form friendships of their own was the perfect way to close out this crossover series. I hadn’t thought of how everyone would fit together, but they meshed together like they’d always known one another and it made me so happy!<br /><br />While I’m sad to say goodbye to Bash and Kieran, Truth or Dare was the perfect send-off for these two.

"KINDLE USE IS GOOD: I recently purchased the kindle version of this book for my kindle TOUCH and so far it is really nice... I go to the TABLE of CONTENTS then to the INDEX and search for the name of the pill/ medication that I am looking for (sometimes it takes a few min, depending on what you are looking for because yes, you do have to start from 'A') and when I find it I click on it and it brings me directly to the medication/pill that I am looking for. The information is easy to read and the majority of it is in ENGLISH (not an obscene amount of med. terminology or nurse shorthand)Even the pill identification charts work, however because I have the touch, it's in black and white and the drawback to the charts is that you have to look through each one, starting at A (however if you can click (touch the side to turn the page) real fast and kinda keep up with it, again, not so bad.)<br /><br />I actually purchased this to help with a project we have called 'drug cards' as I am studying to be a M.Assistant, so this is helping me learn the side effects and everything else listed :) Good book for beginning Med student or pharmacist tech if your not good with the med terminology yet.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Not worth the price point: I really wanted to like this product but for the quality of the rocker, it is not worth it. When taking it out for assembly, some of the plastic pieces had little jagged surfaces and the metal bars were difficult to assemble. I thought I was not putting enough pressure or putting too much pressure assembling it, but when comparing the pieces side by side, they were not even. So some parts were easy to slide on, while others were not.<br /><br />The rocking motion, like others mentioned is definitely not smooth. On a hardwood surface it felt like the rocker would lose balance. We ended up putting a small rug underneath it. The rug helped, and also made the rocking motion a little smoother.<br /><br />The cushion on the chair was soft and plush. A little difficult to take on and off for washing.<br /><br />The positive side of the chair was the height, easy to adjust, and that it was light enough to carry around. I originally purchased this to put my newborn next to me while I ate, but having to drag the rug around with me and double checking to make sure the chair was stable was not worth it. Also, due to the frame size of the chair, this would not work in a smaller home. We ended up returning it because it did not give us peace of mind.<br /><br />There are more sturdier brands to consider with newborn features that you can later convert to highchairs and toddler seats.",2.0,Baby_Products,0,5

"3 Week International Trip - Didn't Hold Up As Well As Expected: We bought this two pack, hoping they'd be sturdier than many of the other luggage tags we've had the misfortune of dealing with.  Solid aluminum, coated steel cable - they've got to be sturdy, right?  Well, kind of.  We just got back from a 3 week trip through Asia, which included 11 flights &amp; 4 train rides (yes, we get around).  One tag made it back with a decent bit of damage.  The other didn't make it back at all.<br /><br />The first one has a few creases in it where it was obviously bent in transit.  This in no way makes it unusable, just a little ugly.  I do think that any additional force on one of the creases will most likely cause it to break on that line.<br /><br />The second one disappeared during a flight - obviously ripped off by the luggage handling equipment at the airport.  This one really surprised us.  The cable that holds these on seemed plenty strong, and is plastic coated (to prevent scratches &amp; rust).  We had joked that the bag's handle would break off before the cable did.  In retrospect, I guess it's good that we were wrong - I'd definitely rather lose a $3 luggage tag than the handle on a $100 suitcase.<br /><br />So these are good luggage tags, and will probably serve a light traveler well for years.  Then again, so would most other tags.  But for those of us who travel rather heavily, they're probably not quite as good as you're hoping when you see the design.",2.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0,10

"Mpow BT Receiver: Just finished a 300mi drive with this receiver in my 550i. I wanted to spend some time with the product before I wrote anything. The Bimmer is not a daily driver so it took a week or so to try it out....<br />PRO; very easy to install (remember I have a BMW 550i), set head unit to AUX, plug in the 3mm pin and USB cable/pwr adapter (all provided). Pair your android like you would to any other BT (I have a Motorola Maxx). Route receiver/pwr wires out of sight as best you can (I'll rewire the pwr and aux port from inside the armrest later). The actual size of the button sized receiver is about a tall as a stack of 5 or 6 quarters). You mount the sticky part of the receiver where you like and the magnetic button is held in place to that. All audio/Idrive/phone/voice work as before. Receiving calls mutes the audio Bluetooth and activate again when the call ends...same as voice/nav functions. Audio quality with the Logic 7 system did not seem to be reduced noticeably. I'm sure there may be some loss in audio quality (it's a bluetooth after all) but I could not hear it. You can skip forward /reverse/+volume/-volume from the button. I like that because it's easier than for me to do it with my phone...and the price is pretty good.<br />CON; The supplied usb pwr adapter is a bit large for me so I replaced it with a smaller 12v adapter I had laying around. I'm not sure whose fault this is but the receiver seems to take a bit of time to sync with my phone if I step out of the car and soon return. it could be the phone..I'm not sure.<br /><br />I'd rather not have to deal with this BT receiver at all, but this is a limitation of my car, not the product. This will suffice until I install a more robust retro kit. I'm not sure how this product will work over time. If this craps out too soon, I'll update this review.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Heartwarming story about a man and his cat: This book is a true story of a person who is recover from heroin addiction. this shows very well in the book and sure the book isnt the most well written book I have read but you have to see it for what it is. Its a story about how a cat could save one mans life. The language here is good but not excellent but that is also one of the strong points about this book because it feels real. A super well written book with good naratives and a lot of action would make the book less real and more like fiction. This is not fiction.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in the story and still the story is very calm at the same time and that is someting I think you have to get used to when reading it. There will not be a lot of information about his addiction and how it felt and horrible stuff that a lot of people are looking for in books, because this book isnt about James addiction, its about his way to recovery and sure he thoughs the subject of drugs and how it felt but its not vivid explanations about how he got high and how it felt.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book and I enjoy Bob. He is smart but then again he is a cat. I wouldnt say that he is the smartest or most uniqueue cat out there but there is something special about him. I have had cats and they have all been special and have some traits Bob has, and some he dont and he has something that they dont have. That is how it is. What I find so special about Bob the cat is how loyal he is. he has some traits that I find in dogs and not in any of the cats I have had.<br /><br />This story is not for everyone and I have seen everything from bad reviews about how fake, badly written and even pet abuse to words of love and admiration. I admire James and Bob and I am happy they meet and got a chance to read this book. this is a fell good book that I enjoyed a lot. I know a lot of people will find hope in this book. I love how it shows how a singel animal, a pet, can chance the life of a person, and it does matter if you are a homeless drug addict trying to recover or the riches man in the world. The pet loves you and are there for you.<br /><br />This book also put the lights on how it is to be homeless and how we as society can help and should help. We have all seen people that are homeless stand and sell the magazine and a lot of us have walked by without even looking and sometimes thinking that we will not sponsor their addiction. After reading this book, things like that get put in a different light and its not sponsoring an addiction, its about sponoring someone who wants to change their lives. I now stop and help, and buy the magazine whenever I can. I have done so in my home country, and in the country where I love even I dont speak the langauge. why? I want to help and give someone hope and this book has helped me to see that.<br /><br />This book is now a few years old but thiss, the topic is very real and maybe even more important today than every. It is a good book and a lot of people can read it, everything from young adults to adults. The language makes it easy access and it gives hope.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"A Brave Work Whose Time Has Come: This book forcefully but respectfully advocates a return to the core essence of the Masonic Order as an Initiatic tradition.  It asserts that Freemasonry is principally a philosophical tradition which helps its observant/active members to advance and develop their character and spirituality, with all that flows therefrom.  The focus of the book is placed appropriately upon the Symbolic (Blue) Lodge as the ""ne plus ultra"" of the Craft where all of this work should take place.<br /><br />The book poignantly but rationally takes issue with the myriad ""distractions"" that the Fraternity has developed over the decades, namely the appendant orders (e.g. York, Scottish Rites, Knights Templar) and other quasi- or Masonic-related clubs (e.g. Shrine, OES, etc.).  This is where the author is courageous. The ideas in this short treatise are not likely to sit well with literally thousands of good members of the Order who see Freemasonry's objectives and emphasis in a different light.  Fortunately, the author is circumspect and smart enough to acknowledge the 'many paths' argument and as such, largely avoids pedantry in advancing his opinions (opinions which I know are widely shared but rarely so openly stated). With virtually every page, I found himself thinking ""this is exactly what I've always thought as well.""<br /><br />The book also focuses concisely on issues regarding the pursuit of excellence in working at what Freemasons profess to hold central.  It treats of such seemingly incidental issues as dress codes, decorum and the festive board.  In fact, Observing the Craft makes clear that dress, decorum and the festive board are central to how brethren should view their attachment and dedication to the Fraternity. The repeated references to Craftsmanship are not surprising and are obviously appropriate.<br /><br />There is little doubt that Observing the Craft is a clarion call, or a manifesto of sorts. Manifestos always the ruffle feathers of the comfortable and powerful.  It is one of a small number of writings that have sprung up in the last 5-7 years in particular aimed at a reformation or renaissance within the Masonic Fraternity (the most famous or infamous perhaps to date being ""A Laudable Pursuit""). This is the latest, and in my opinion ranks alongside ""Laudable Pursuit"" as the most lucid works aimed at elevating the Masonic experience.  While it will surely be viewed as a bit strident by many, such forceful opinions, respectfully communicated and solidly supported, are what so many of the younger cohort of Freemasons and postulants are in accord with and seeking to see expressed.<br /><br />In the end, Observing the Craft may be controversial but it need not be in a fraternity where respect for multiple opinions is to be valued. Ideally, book discussions (starting with this one) should ensue in Lodges across the various lands where Masons may be found. As sitting Master of the eminent Alexandria-Washington Lodge # 22, the author is in a unique position to be heard on these matters and to presumably influence the future direction of that august Lodge and others by extension.<br /><br />Observing the Craft deserves widespread coverage throughout the Fraternity worldwide and deserves discussion as to its thesis and supporting ideas.<br /><br />Postcript: The book utilizes the English spelling of certain words (e.g. labour, organisation) which a prior reviewer took as a typogrpahical glitch or mispelling, which they are not.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Great Book on Embracing God's Design for Women: Do you feel fulfilled as a woman of God? Do you struggle with your biblical boundaries in serving your church? What exactly does biblical womanhood look like?<br /><br />If you have pondered these questions, then the book “The Accidental Feminist: Restoring Our Delight in God’s Good Design” by Courtney Reissig is for you. Courtney begins her book by sharing her own view of the feminist movement and how it affected her thinking as a young woman. She explains the difference between complementarians and egalitarians.<br /><br />&#34;Women like me call ourselves complementarians, believing that God created men and women equal, yet different. And our differences are designed to complement one another.&#34;<br /><br />Using scripture, Courtney walks us through Genesis 2 explaining God’s design for us as women. She effectively defines what it means to be a helper.<br /><br />&#34;Growing as a helper means having a Philippians 2:5-11 mindset, where we consider humility and service as more important than our immediate glory. It is not demeaning, any more than Christ laying his life down for us was demeaning of his full deity.&#34;<br /><br />I love that she places great emphasis on being part of a local church and developing and cultivating your gifts within it. She also addresses the issues of submission, modesty and our homes.<br /><br />&#34;Purity is not a list of rules to be followed. It is not a ring to be worn or a card to be signed. It is a lifestyle (Titus 2:4-5). It is a lifestyle of a person who has been bought with Christ’s blood and loves God the Father. It is a lifestyle of war, where we daily flee from sin (1 Cor. 6:18).&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The purpose of the home is to be a place of refuge, grace and productivity-not a platform for me to prove what a great homemaker I am. God is to get the glory in our homes.&#34;<br /><br />Ultimately, that is what we do when we delight in the design God intended us to fulfill. We bring Him glory and show the world who God is. I highly recommend this book for those wanting to do just that.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

Love this: This is a great watercolor set! It has every color and it blends very easily. It is very high quality and I have had it for a year and it still is like brand new. You are able to mix the watercolor to be thinner or thicker and it comes with a little tray to mix your own colors in as well. The only down side is I wish it had a darker green instead of having to mix my own. But other than that I recommend.

"Decent Eastern European Cookbook: I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The recipes were not unusual.  If you've read some Eastern European/Russian cookbooks, you'll have seen these before.  I don't mind the conversational/paragraph style of recipe myself, but I know some people do not like it.<br /><br />The book is very heavy on pictures of decorated food.  Some of them are very attractive - some of them are not.  I read this book on the Kindle Paperwhite, but the pictures may be a little better in color.  I also felt like the large number of people made the book a little slow to turn pages, but that might just be me.<br /><br />The author is British/European, but all equivalent measurements are provided.

"It's OK, If you have Echo products and use a family plan: I wanted to love Amazon Music Unlimited, but in the end I just like it. It's getting rid of allowing me to add my own collection to the service is ending, but it didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work. I really don't like not being able to play songs I own and that Amazon doesn't make available. Though to be fair, other services appear to be dropping this as well.<br /><br />Creating playlists in the app is harder than necessary, and somehow I've ended up with 2 near identical copies of many of my playlists. I still don't know how that happened. And when I tell the app to shuffle a large playlist it doesn't do a very good job of shuffling. It tends to play a lot of songs in order.<br /><br />I do like the integration with Alexa, and use it often.<br /><br />In the end I would say it's worth the cost if you get a discount for having Prime or an Echo device, or if you use the family plan and have an Echo device. Either way it's mainly an OK deal IF you have an Echo device. Otherwise, without any Echo devices I'd probably go with the Evil Empire and their service, which still allows you to play your own songs along with their songs.",3.0,Unknown,0,32

"Small Stars and Stripes Bowl is Perfect for My Parents' Small Cat, Angel: DII's Stars and Stripes Ceramic Pet Bowl coordinates well with DII's Stars and Stripes Pet Bed. Both are very patriotic. My parents' small female cat, Angel, is a Flame Point Siamese. She was a stray cat that my parents adopted. She's not patriotic but my parents are very patriotic. Dad served in the Vietnam War. Angel loves drinking and eating out of her Stars and Stripes Ceramic Pet Bowl. The bowl has a silicon rim on its bottom that keeps it from sliding around, spilling its contents. My parents keep it on the marble hearth in the living room. Because she was once a stray, and because she sheds extensively, Angel is primarily an outdoor cat. When she comes inside from the wooden patio deck, my parents allow her to drink or eat from her Stars and Strips Ceramic Bowl. The small size bowl is perfect for her.<br /><br />My parents keep the bowl next to the Stars and Stripes Pet Bed from DII. The bed is also a small size and is perfect for Angel; she will take short afternoon naps in it. Sometimes, Mom will pick up the bed, with Angel sleeping in it, and gently rock it in her lap. When Angel gets tired, she will leap out of the bed and trod downstairs to the basement's workshop where she lives. DII Stars and Stripes Ceramic Pet Bowl is easy to clean. My parents don't put it in the dishwasher; instead, they wash it by hand. Also, they haven't put it in the microwave oven. I could see where one could because the dish is very thick and sturdy. It is a bowl that is suitable for humans to dine from. It would make a great gift for your beloved cat, especially around the 4th of July.",5.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26

"A Hardworking African-American Mother Inspires Us All: This is a book written by a hard-working, never-say-die, African-American mother of three boys. It is from the heart. She covers topics that many of us don’t discuss easily and she does it with almost childlike transparency. She believes in God. And she has had her shares of troubles. Anybody who has a sense of the woes of parenthood today needs to read this book. And while they’re at it, learn much about the modern African-American experience of life in America.<br />Let me say straight out that this is not a scholarly tome.  While she writes well, the book did not have the benefit of professional editing given the limited resources Eddie Marie Durham had –  what it got in that regard was a wonderful labor of love from a friend. So set that aside and don’t let it interfere with Eddie’s message – it just may help save your child and you.  Here is just a glimpse of what she shares.<br />As a trained educator, Eddie starts off with the premise of “you better know what you’re getting into if you’re thinking of becoming a parent.”  She was shocked when she learned about a group of young teens in her own school forming a pact to become ‘mothers’. In fact, much of the beginning of the book is intended to warn young women about having babies before “they really know what it’s all about.”  And she does so very capably.<br />Then she begins her specific lessons: Early she provides us with an educated view on discipline. It’s not a dirty word and it doesn’t always mean corporeal punishment. While she believes in spanking when totally necessary, she also recognizes that in today’s world where the social mores are against it, it is not appropriate for the most part.<br />Whatever she shares, she does it most frankly, especially on topics not easily talked about. One example is her husband’s earlier life and his son by another woman. And then there’s the experience she and her first son had with the Boy Scouts – heartbreaking, but handled well by Eddie.<br />What struck me while reading this book is the incredible similarity of hopes and cares or concerns and struggles and fears that this mother had with what many of us have experienced as parents.  Parenthood, at its foundation, is not bias to color.<br />She writes about the importance of two parents, a father and a mother in a child’s life, both of whom are partnering with God in the raising of that child. But Durham realizes that is not always possible.<br />Early in the book she lays out very clearly the importance of rules and quoting one of her devotional readings, she reminds us that the story behind the famous movie, Bonnie and Clyde, was indeed, “who raised Bonnie”. She then proceeds to share some gems she found with respect to rules – how to explain them; how to enforce; and what to avoid. She quotes one adolescent program director as follows: “When the responsibilities expected of children are significantly lower than the privileges allowed, that is a cause for concern.” Then shortly afterwards, she outlines her own mother’s unique set of 12 rules for her children as well as the reason(s) for each one. Well worth the book’s purchase for that alone. Lastly in this regard, Durham discusses the topic of homework and what it is meant to accomplish quoting considerable research on the topic.<br />She is not a big fan of television’s impact on children with respect to the reality of life. She shares how she dealt with her son’s sports accidents as well as her feelings about his first date. Handling the eldest son’s decision to move out was not easy. And then there were the serious illnesses that beset one of her son’s, then the wife of another, and then the author herself. Even the fact that her husband retired and hung around the house while she still worked and how that impacted the child-rearing, makes for an interesting read.  All excellently handled, providing for us a role model of what being a parent – even of grown-up adults is all about.<br />The author, a post-graduate educated elementary school teacher, now retired, resides in Texas. One of her passions throughout her career was to write poems, stories, and plays making difficult accounts more understandable to children of all ages, as well as a means of celebrating and remembering the event described. Durham often works these works into her writings as examples of what she as a parent was called to do sometimes.<br />We often hear of kids from tough lives succeeding because of what their mother was like – what she did, what she said at times, her sacrifices, how she showed her love even when things were tough and there was no money, and so on. Eddie Durham is one of those mothers – only she’s telling the story of her sons and how they got to be who they are. Personally, I consider myself fortunate to have come across Durham and her book.  I highly recommend it to all thinking of parenthood or those already in its throes.<br />Ken B. Godevenos, Toronto, Ontario, October 28, 2016.",4.0,Books,1,7

As a child I didn't get glasses until I was in 2nd grade and it was evident that I needed them sooner. There just wasn't a good way for my parent to know. I feel more confident that we will be able to catch any decline in my kids sight having this on hand.<br /><br />I would suggest storing it flat and pressed for a while after opening. It is still curled a bit, but it did improve.<br /><br />I plan to keep this in storage, stored flat, in between screenings. This gives it a better chance to flatten out and prevents the kids from memorizing the shapes.<br /><br />Overall this is pretty cute and useful, just a but harder to get the curl out than expected. 4/5",4.0,Industrial_and_Scientific,1,19

"I scared my neighbor haha: I was using the flash light part to run to my car in my apartment complex late one night. One of my neighors scared me from the noise he was making taking out his trash. I hit the button as I jumped,he heard it and saw it and ran to the garbage dumpster threw his stuff in. Gave me a look like i was crazy and fastly walked back to his apartment. I love it. I bought this about 7 months ago and never wrote a review, I happened upon it and said I need to let people know the battery life is still good. I've bought lots of things with rechargeable batteries and the whole thing usually ends up in the trash. This guns life is still kicking and it doesn't seem to die down, I plug it in about once a month, just in case it may need a charge, I test it about twice a month, no problems, great flashlight too, I never have to worry about finding batteries for it, it is always ready to go. Great price too.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Misting the garden: This nozzle is great for starting plants from seed.  It gives a very fine mist that doesn't disturb the soil.  It's also great once the seedlings start.  On low humidity days, I'll use the nozzle to mist some of my plants.  I have a nozzle attached to a fixture so I can slowly soak various areas of the yard without excessive run off.",5.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,1,25
Lasted 2 years: So far so good. Kept my bike clean n dry for a week now with 3 days of rain. A thick material but not too thick. Great for all season. Not sure how it will hold up in a blizzard yet. My last cheap walmart one shredded in every wind storm. But this one has nice elastic around bottom. A middle adjustable clip strap to go under the bike n keep secure. 2 holes in the front bottom for extra bungies or a lock. 2 reflective stripes on the front top. which is nice to know how to put it on. i always was turning my last one to get it to fit right. I have a 2003 vstar 1100 with bags n windshield and it fits wonderful on it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well this one lasted almost 2 years. The strap that goes in the middle completely ripped off n also there's 2 ripped holes shredded in it.,3.0,Automotive,0,4

"A Different Take on Vampires: Kiera Hudson Is a constable in England that decides to take an assignment to The Ragged Cove. Her father is dead and her mother has gone missing so being assigned to the remote town does not bother her. The two books together read as one and I am sure the rest of the books in the series will also go seamlessly together. Kiera is intuitive and a great detective but she is not prepared for the murders she has to investigate in Ragged Cove.  She is thrust right away into a murder investigation that soon becomes clear it is a serial killer at work.  Her belief system is tested and soon she is asked to believe in vampires and vampyrus.  She also becomes aware that she is more a part of this world than she at first thought. She also must question who she can trust.<br />Kiera and the other characters are interesting and different and their interactions are not always predictable. I enjoyed the way the author kept you guessing on who was actually good and who was bad. At the end we are left guessing whether Kiera will find happiness or not, though I am sure we will find out in the ensuing novels.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"Great Value: While it puts out a good bit more light than  the inexpensive speedlights costing only $30 less, it puts out considerably less light that the high end ones do. No zoom. That being said, the quality and flexibility of these lights is extremely good. I have used them quite a bit since I purchased them (I got 2) and they have worked flawlessly. Recycle time is much faster than other lights I have used in this price range. The beep when ready feature is nice. It's a basic light (no TTL), but frankly the price you pay for the fancy features in other lights is way too high for the way I use the lights. Overall, I'm really happy with these. May buy some more to replace the slightly cheaper ones I also use currently.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Didn't Want Series to End: I bought this book when it was on sale because I fell in love with the cover. Then I bought the first two because I can't read a series out of order. Unfortunately, this series was written or published out of order. Read Spy's Honor first. It happens 4-5 years before Assassin's Gambit.<br /><br />A lot of times when I read a series, I find the later books start getting repetitive and formulaic. Not so with this series. At least, not so far. I love how each book carries the continuity of the world building but has its own flavor. Spy's Honor introduced familiars, sea and shroud mages, and spies while this book focused on fire mages, volcanoes, and assassination attempts.<br /><br />This story is about Celeste, who has serious confidence issues thanks to her marriage to the villain in Assassin's Gambit. She made a very sympathetic character that I immediately connected with. I also liked the hero, Prince Rayn, and I like how Lucien was portrayed with a sense of humor in this one.<br /><br />Of the first three, this book was the most poetic. Oh, it didn't have actual poetry in it, but some of the descriptions, especially of the fire and fire spirits, were poetic. Raby really has a way with words. I found myself highlighting passages simply for the beauty of them.<br /><br />I've gotten so attached to these characters and this world, I'm sorry to be nearing the end of the series. It's really made me appreciate the fantasy genre more.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20
