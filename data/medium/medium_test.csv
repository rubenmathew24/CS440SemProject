"What kind of high school is this???: Our school system is already in enough trouble without throwing a bunch of horny oversexed teachers in the mix.

"Wow: I loved this book!  I recommend you read the prequels first (The Storm and The Darkness, Shattered).  It gives you the background you need to understand the family dynamics and why there is so much turmoil.  I could not put it down.  It‚Äôs a unique paranormal read.  I was not expecting the celestial twist or the Nephilim similarity.  Sarah Cradit definitely surprised me with that plot twist.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"heavy and exergerated charger: I think I made a mistake in chosing this item, because this is heavy and I don't feel like taking it anywhere.

I bought an ultrasonic diffuser before this ...: I am new to the diffusing world, but I wanted something without plastic and I think this is the only diffuser out there without plastic. Plus, it looks pretty cool. I bought an ultrasonic diffuser before this one and you put mostly water with very little oil. The scent in the ultrasonic diffuser can be strong at first but seems to fade. This diffuser is potent. I am very sensitive to smells, but I have even had someone come in my house and ask where the smell was coming from. Plus, you just use oil and nothing else. I haven't had to clean it yet but I hear it is easy. The seems a sample oil of their blends and it smells awesome! I recommend ordering their oils.",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Not only bad advice, but possibly harmful to infants: Dr. Zukow may have 30 years experience as a pediatrician, but he obviously has not bothered to learn anything new since then.  He gives off-handed advice that flies in the face of what current research shows is healthiest and safest for babies.  Some examples of his advice:<br />Put your baby to sleep on his stomach.  He will sleep longer.<br />Formula feeding is healthier and preferable to breastfeeding.<br />It is a great idea to put babies in daycare, even if you are a stay-at-home mom.  Yes, babies in daycare get more ear infections, but the trade-off (of more free time for mom) is worth it.<br />Starting solids as early as 4 weeks is fine.<br />Babies should never be allowed to feed on demand.  It is too exhausting for parents.  If a baby wants to eat sooner than every 3 hours, let him cry or give him sugar water.<br />No wonder this book was in the clearance section of my local book store!

Not what I expected: Does not block wind well even at 55-60 mph let alone high speeds. Does take a while for them to darken in sunlight but you can only tell from the outside. Looks clear from the inside and I still had to squint. I thought it was a great idea to have to only carry one pair but not worth the gamble. My wife however though they were cute so I gave them to her seeing how I block most the wind for her. I live by reviews and write many.

"Adequate Headphones for the Price: Great pair of headphones for folks on a budget.<br /><br />They come in a variety of attractive colors; I bought think pink & white. I love that they're collapsible because headphones can be unwieldy. Comes with a sleek carrying case that includes a detachable wristband. The ear pillows are super soft, which is a huge plus - I can't stand uncomfortable headphones.<br /><br />Sound quality leaves something to be desired but it's not terrible. Has nice deep bass. Noise canceling is decent.<br /><br />Comes with a plethora of features such as FM radio, micro SD card slot, and Bluetooth. The FM radio is useless - it won't tune into any stations. Comes with a USB charging cable and stereo extension cable.<br /><br />Overall, a nice pair of headphones for cheap. I definitely recommend these if you want to rock out I your own little world without throwing down a ton of money.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"THE CHRONICLES OF DAN LEE O‚ÄôBRIEN by DAVID JORDAN @daverayjord: The Chronicles of Dan Lee O‚ÄôBrien is a collection of 11 short stories of varying lengths, following the exploits of the protagonist, Dan Lee O‚ÄôBrien, as Irish reality and Irish mythology are intertwined.<br /><br />The themes of magic and fantasy are clearly underpinned in each story, and the reoccurring appearances of Dan Lee helped to establish a chronology ‚Äì albeit a non-linear one. My favourite story was called The Evil Eye, and it reminded me of the story of Cyclops, from Greek mythology, and worked in some sarcastic humour, which I like to see.<br /><br />For some reason, I never managed to get into books about mythology ‚Äì I enjoyed the film adaptations, but even the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan failed to captivate me.<br /><br />However, The Chronicles of Dan Lee O‚ÄôBrien allowed Jordan to display some original ideas on a topic I‚Äôve never come across before.  If you are an avid fan of mythology, Irish history and the fantasy genre, I think you will really like the scenarios Jordan has created in each story. However, there did seem to be a strong expectation throughout the book that the reader would be familiar with these things. If, like me, you‚Äôre not, then you will find the purpose and importance of each character and setting difficult to understand.<br /><br />I also thought that a lot of the stories seemed to favour dialogue over narration. I didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy this choice, as I felt it removed the opportunity to describe the characters and surroundings in better detail.<br /><br />Plus, a lot of the sentences were quite short and simple ‚Äì quite a contrast for someone who loves Classic novels with sentences that last forever!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this gave the narrator and speakers quite a blunt, negative tone, which I‚Äôm sure wasn‚Äôt intentional!<br /><br />Overall, I think Jordan needs to work on his style and descriptive technique, but his core ideas are intriguing. But hey, this is his first book and it‚Äôs an impressive achievement ‚Äì regardless of the improvements I think need to be made. Sadly, I don‚Äôt quite think this specific genre was my cup of tea but I am in no doubt that if you‚Äôre a fan of all things mythological, you will find this book fascinating!",3.0,Books,0,7

"The best of the DVDs: This is the only dvd of all the Baby Einstein DVDs I own, that my son will watch again and again.  He has watched this from 3 months old and it still holds his attention at 19 months old.  I remember thinking that I wished I had another one like it so that I could play something else he would like just as much.  I purchased it after visiting my sister who owned this, and this allowed us a little time to do other things while my nephew and my son watched it over and over.  I couldn't say that about any other dvd at that time.  I think people who are confused by the many languages are confused, but I don't think the babies are confused at all.  I normally don't even write reviews on products I have purchased as it is very time consuming, but felt the need because of the negative reviews.  All babies are different.  My other friend recommended the World Animals one, and my son couldn't care less about that one.  Oh well, live and learn with your little one.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"The Theater of Lost Souls: This play presents a very cynical view of the theater which I hope is not true to life. According to a clich√©d cynical view, show business is full of egomaniacs who just want to stand in the spotlight. It is all vanity! And when the performer can't stand in the spotlight, he or she self-destructs and becomes a drunk or a drug addict. Certainly this happens but I think the vast majority of theater artists are genuine artists who are seeking to explore their humanity. Most theater artists understand that true adoration comes from a greatness of the soul given life on the stage, and not from a big ego. But Halley Feiffer is more involved in the theater than I am so it troubles me that she should write such a play. I would hope that theater artists would have a lot more insight. Ultimately the theater is about self-actualization and not self-aggrandizement.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Where Love Comes to Die: Where love comes to die.<br /><br />Several years ago I attempted to watch this film and couldn't make it to the first madrigal.  I'm not kidding.  Bored early this morning I decided to give it another shot and an entirely different reaction took place:  overwhelmed.  I've had a lifelong love of all things Monteverdi and the madrigal books were amongst the first works of his I fell for.  Hard.  The idea of setting Monteverdi's Fourth Book of Madrigals (complete) to a lip-synched film of modern couples breaking up in a posh London restaurant somehow just did not feel ""right."" This time through however, I got exactly what director John La Bouchardiere felt when he thought this a great idea for a short (hour long) film.<br /><br />While it isn't necessary to have visualizations for Monteverdi's grand excursion into love and loss to make their point - the music and word settings make their point(s) beautifully sans pictures, La Bouchardiere nonetheless achieves something beautiful and manages to capture the heartbreak by sharing the breakups of six couples occuring simultaneously in a single night.<br /><br />Through the use of changing camera lenses, lighting, filters and various techniques (most notably cineme verite) and brief flashback sequences, we see the couples loving and losing.  We see them on camping trips, christenings, post love making (discretely, no nudity here) and feel their sense of elation and doom - all of which somehow gracefully compliment Monteverdi's difficult, often stunning harmonizations and beautifully sung polyphony.  The richness of his a capella score, lays wide open the naked emotions with an often brutal power that LaBouchardiere captures with a sure and natural sense of timing, knowing where to place and leave his cameras, when to cut to a flashback, where to allow the reaction shots - all of it flowing in seamless rhythm with the music.<br /><br />The vocal ensemble I Fagiolini, paired with silent actors make up the entire cast all of whom hold the hour long film together as if their lives depended upon it.  I Fagiolini approach the music powerfully and often full voiced as opposed to the delicacy frequently heard from many other early music groups.  The result is an often thrilling (and raw) soundscape of theatricality unique in this style of music.  The ""sighing"" quality so necessary in this music is not eliminated by such an approach but rather becomes a highlight because of the more complex dynamics and shadings of the ensemble.  They're simply wonderful.<br /><br />I can imagine many (most?) might feel the same as I did when first trying to watch this, but - if you've got an hour and can open your heart to some of the most exquisite music ever written to being performed - to being the ""script"" for an oddly beautiful film, I strongly recommend this gem of a movie.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22
"Great for little animal lovers!: This is a great dvd.  Our daughter really loved it!  She really loves Diego beacuse he is an animal rescuer!  This dvd introduced her to dinosaurs.  It introduced the dinosaurs in a gentle way that wasn't too scary for a toddler and give them a nice place to start to learn about the dinosaurs.  It has inspired my daughter to learn more about the different types of dinosaurs.  Sometimes, the dinosaurs are portrayed as scary to a toddler. The music is nice-a little too much for mommy-but, my daughter liked to dance to it when it was on.  The other eposides are ones that have been already aired.  But, they are perfect for the Go Diego Go addict.  Also, the dinosaur episode also features Dora & Diego's sister, Alicia (who is my daughter's favourite).  It has a little something for everyone.  As for the going back in time, my daughter sees it as imagination & pretend.  So, that part didn't bother her.<br /><br />Basically, it is a great buy for any Diego lover.  The bonus is the introduction into learning about dinosaurs!",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Clear explanations but not unbiased: The best thing about this book is that it is easier to follow than many of the other books that have been written on this topic.  One needs to be reasonably intelligent, but does not need a degree in political science, economics, or finance, in order to grasp the ideas presented.  The worst thing about the book is that it is clearly written by authors with an undeniable preference for the Democratic party.  One example: in classifying deficit spending by party, the authors choose to begin their analysis in 1980 and to ignore the recent past even though the book was published in 2011.  This allows them to blame the Republicans and exonerate the Democrats.  It's also worth noting that they do this by relying on a carefully chosen sample of 4 observations (3 Republicans: Reagan, Bush 1, and Bush 2; 1 Democrat: Clinton).  In a related vein, they choose to blame the huge deficits of 2009-2010 (and thereafter) on ""Bush era policy"" rather than on Obama presidency.  In the few places where President Obama is mentioned, it is argued that he inherited a bad economy that was caused by Bush and therefore the deficits under his presidency are not his fault.  I find this interesting because they don't give Reagan the same deniability even though he too inherited a pretty lousy economy.  Instead, Reagan is largely credited with creating the whole national debt problem.  I'm not a big fan of either party but I saw one professional review included on the book cover that claimed this book was ""unbiased"" and I just had to laugh.  In conclusion, I think this is a great book but one has to be aware of the authors' agenda.",4.0,Books,1,7

"An Excellent, Must Read book on General Management!: This has to be my current overall ""Favorite Management Book"". It's just packed full of straight-forward, clear advice from the modern master of management (not to be confused with the past master Drucker and the future master Peters). Say what you will about his bloated retirement package, this man knows what it take to win and covers all the basics in this excellent book!<br /><br />Below are just a few of the many, many, many great tidbits from the book:<br /><br />* Have a positive attitude and spread it around. Never let yourself be a victim, and for goodness sake - have fun!<br /><br />* All-purpose list of values are easily said but not easily followed and is just the price of admission (service, respect, etc.). Always, always, always, talk about the mission! Make values real by reward and punishment.<br /><br />* Biggest dirty secret in business is lack of candor. With candor you get idea rich, gain speed, cut costs. People don't speak their mind because it's easier not to (no anger, pain, confusion, resentment). Not being candid is about self-interest, making your life easier.<br /><br />* Differentiation: Companies win when management makes clear and meaningful distinction between the top and bottom performers. When it cultivates the strong and culls the weak. Differentiation is the fairest and kindest approach overall where everyone is a winner. Differentiation is about resource allocation. Managers invest where there is payback and cut losses elsewhere. Protecting non-performers always backfire! Drains energy, causes resentment, unfair, and no candor! In downturn, nice under performers are always the first to go. And they are always surprised and hurt! You are never too nice to differentiate, only too cowardly. Best Performance Review: straight, honest, you know where you stand, and what you need to do.<br /><br />* The Rules of What a Leader Does: Relentlessly upgrade their team by using every interaction as an opportunity to evaluate, coach, and increase self-confidence. Make sure people not only know the vision but live and breathe it. Get into everyone's skin, exuding positive energy and optimism. Establish trust by practicing candor, transparency, and credit. Have the courage to make unpopular decisions and gut calls. Leaders probe and push with a curiosity that borders on skepticism. Making sure their questions are answered with action. Inspire leading and risk taking by setting example. Leaders celebrate.<br /><br />* Hiring - 3 Acid tests: Integrity - Do they tell the truth and keep their word. Do they take responsibility for past actions, admit mistakes, and play to win by the rules. Intelligence - Can work with smart people and display intellectual curiosity. Maturity - Can withstand the heat and setbacks. Respects emotions of others. Handles success with humility.<br /><br />* 4E and 1P Framework: First E is positive Energy. Second E is ability to Energize others (Candidates must have the first 2, they can't be trained in). Third E is Edge - Ability to make the tough yes/no decisions. Forth E is Execute - Ability to get the job done. Final P is Passion to win.<br /><br />* Steps for change: Attach every change initiative to a clear purpose or goal. Hire and promote True Believers and Get on With It types. Ferret out and get rid of resistors, even if their performance is satisfactory.<br /><br />* Strategy is about resource allocation. Choices about how to compete. Think about: What the playing field looks like now? What is the competition up to? What you've been up to? What's around the corner? What's your winning move?<br /><br />* Leadership is helping other people grow and succeed. Don't do the predictable! Do more! Do something different!",5.0,Unknown,1,32

But the steady feature is a good option for night rides on the bike path when I need light to see not just be seen. I don't ride on dark roads with no street lights so I'm not sure how well it would light in that environment. I've used it in the rain and snow and find the waterproof feature also works well.

"UPDATE: In my last review I was not too thrilled with my suitcases. The zipper separated on my first trip. Maybe I over packed. I don‚Äôt know. However I was contacted by the company and they offered to send me out a new set, and since returns are free I decided to go for it. I am getting the silver set this time. I was hesitant to try the champagne again even though it was very pretty.<br /><br />I am impressed with how they are standing by their product. It‚Äôs not often you will find someone who does that these days. Especially when you are purchasing from a third party like Amazon  I‚Äôll keep you posted on how I like my new set, but I say if you‚Äôre in the market for some new luggage you give this company a chance.

"Excellent for the price.: I ordered the JLabs J4M headset about a week or two ago and I am totally satisfied with the sound quality.  They're a bit bass-heavy as opposed to other headsets I've used (most notably Shure E2c). I tend to really enjoy the bass, but someone with a different style may find them a bit to thumpy.  I listen to a lot of double-bass drum and power chord-heavy metal music and it suits, with the highs coming in to cut the underlying thunder-like lows.  I'm not super impressed with most of the silicone tips that came with the headset, but the smallest ones seem to be sufficient unless you just REALLY have a big ear canal. The set also came with a very nifty carrying case.  Bulky...but neat and keeps them from tangling in your pocket or bag.  The flat cable is truly awesome in that it resists kinking and twisting. The only downside to the flat cable is it makes it a little difficult to wear them in the common upside-down-and-behind-the-ear configuration to reduce microphonics. The microphone is fairly clear, even in a vehicle when worn in one ear as a standard phone headset.  The multi-function button works when trying to play/pause the music player or answer/end a call, but on my HTC Hero running Android 2.1 firmware with HTC Sense UI, the button does not command the phone to skip forward or backward tracks.  Double click will actually redial the last number instead.  Overall, not totally balanced as far as sound goes, but if you like it heavy, they're great.  And if you HAVE to have the track skip feature, check your phone's compatibility, first.  I found these for about $50 w/ free shipping. Given the cons, I'd say this was fair based on construction and sound quality. If you find them for $100, you may or may not want to fork out the dough, especially if you aren't sure that the multi-function button is going to work on your phone or not.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Excellent sound isolation.<br />2) Slightly unbalanced sound range leaning more towards baritone and bass areas = great for rock, metal, jazz, others.<br />3) Excellent cable quality and flat cable construction with SERIOUS reinforcement around plug and y-splitter.<br />4) Nifty (but bulky) zip up carry case<br />5) Microphone!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Multi-function button doesn't work properly on my model HTC Android headset despite being listed as HTC compatible.<br />2) Cable is a tad too short to have in ears while phone is on hip holster or in pocket.<br />3) Most of the tips are very large and therefore, not usable. (This could just be me, so don't read too much into this one.)<br /><br />If you can get them for $50 or so, get them. Not sure if they're worth getting if they're listed for any higher prices unless your phone is 100% compatible with the multifunction button and you enjoy bass heavy music.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

Used as intended, it's UNDER AN UMBRELLA! Rain falls down where I live, not up! ;-) For $22.00, you're not going to do much better than this. Even with my ""Cons"" listed below, I would buy it again.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Light is easy to attach securely and centers nicely on the pole.<br />* The white lights give MORE than adequate lighting over our 36"" x 72"" patio table, and are dimmable.<br />* The yellow lights give a nice ambient light for chilling-out under, but aren't bright enough to ""do"" anything under.<br />* The white up-lights are a nice touch, but I don't use them much. (see ""Cons"")<br />* I've used this on full-bright white for about 10 hours (a couple hours at a time) now with no noticeable loss in brightness, so it seems to be pretty efficient on a set of standard Duracell's.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* The power switch has been sketchy since day one. It always turns on at first touch, but sometimes takes 2-3 pushes to turn light off. I don't know if this is due to the same switch being used for the dimmer, or if the switch is bad.<br />* I wish the up-lighting was selectable with the yellow lights, or by themselves.<br />* It's made out of a hard plastic that probably wouldn't survive being dropped. I'd like to see it made from a better grade of plastic. However, if this is a deal-killer for you, then you probably shouldn't be changing standard light bulbs or drinking from anything made of glass! ;-)",4.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

The Best Franck Symphony in D Minor Recorded by Bernstein and other french Orchestral Works: In This CD Cesar Franck's Symphony In D Minor was recorded at St. George Hotel in Brooklyn almost 60 years ago in 1959 Bernstein makes this the best recording of Cesar Franck's Symphony In D Minor. and it is a very good recording. But the one he recorded on DG in the early 80s is a little too slow. There are some other French composers on this CD Faure's Ballade for Piano and Orchestra with Robert Casadesus is very good and rounding out the CD are 2 works for Violin and Orchestra both feature Zino Francestti  in the Chausson work called Pome for violin and orchestra is very good and closing out the CD is by Ravel called Tizgane. Both Casadesus and Francestti are very good soloists and they perform with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic in this great CD of French music recorded 55 to 60 years ago.

"Works, but do not recommend for Presta valve: This pump is bad at presta valve inflation.<br /><br />I was able to convert it from Schrader, that wasn't too hard... although I had to slightly stretch the spring in removing it.<br /><br />When using for presta: The sealing part is miss-sized (it fits too tightly) making it physically quite hard to put on-and-off the valve. When inflating pressures above 90psi, the pump is hard to push down, and tends to wobble under force. The final problem is when removing the pump from the valve after inflation, the miss-sized seal in the head is difficult to pull off the valve, and lots of air leaks out. While this pump works, I do not recommend it.",2.0,Unknown,0,32

"Night Watch: Kendra Michaels had been born blind and for her first twenty years of her life her other senses became overly developed as a way for her to adapt without her sight. When a revolutionary medical procedure developed by England‚Äôs Night Watch Project became available to Kendra she finds herself being able to see for the first time in her life. Kendra with her newfound site began to work with law enforcement as a consultant with the help of her overly developed senses along with her new found sight.<br /><br />Kendra receives a visit from Dr. Charles Waldridge who had been the one that returned Kendra's sight and she didn't think everything was well with him. That very night though the doctor that Kendra feels she owes everything to has come up missing so Kendra is determined to do whatever she can to find him before it's to late. Making contact with those she's worked with before Kendra jumps right into the investigation and won't give up until she knows what happened.<br /><br />Night Watch is the fourth book in the Kendra Michaels series by Iris Johansen. This however is the first of this series I've read so I was jumping in a bit blind myself as to what had gone on in the first three books. I think for the most part this one read fine as a standalone with the exception of possibly some background information on the characters. There are things mentioned here and there that I wasn't sure if it had happened in previous books or was new information to the story but overall the author does a good job of catching the reader up on the series and characters making the read enjoyable.<br /><br />This particular book in the series was full of the action that I have come to expect from an Iris Johansen story. Kendra is a strong, determined female lead that while she often seems a bit quirky she was extremely likable and fun to follow as she tried to solve the case. I don't know what the previous books focused on but this one seemed to really drive Kendra to solve the case with her personal involvement with Dr. Waldridge.<br /><br />Overall, another really solid read from Iris Johansen, action packed and intense all the way through.<br /><br />I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Portable, Waterproof & Great Sound Quality!: I've been using this speaker a lot recently and I must say I really am enjoying it! It feels well made and doesn't feel cheap. It is made from a nice rubberized plastic and all the ports are covered and protected from water. It even comes with a nice suction stand that screws in so you don't have to have it in if you don't want to. The suction cup is pretty strong and sticks to the edge of my pool nicely.<br /><br />The sound quality is very nice for its size and it does have a good bit of bass to it as well - I was actually very surprised by that!<br /><br />It's not too heavy and is a nice size so it is very portable and can clip to a backpack while hiking.<br /><br />When it was near my pool it was splashed a good bit and it still works just fine.<br /><br />If you need a quality, great sounding speaker, you can't go wrong with this one!",5.0,Unknown,1,32

It has a high and low heat setting that puts out enough head to take the chill off the room after about an hour.  The flames are so realistic it is unbelievable.

"This is a bad continuation/adaptation: I read and loved the entirety of the Mike Carey series. I love the tv show, even though it‚Äôs way off base. I even like Black‚Äôs run. But this is awful. Lucifer is much less the shaper of the world and much more the devil in this series when he is lucid at all. There is no joy and only pure suffering. While the art is... fine(?) the disjointed melancholic ‚Äústory‚Äù feels out of place and underdeveloped. If this is a sequel to any of the series preceding it, it is virtually unrecognizable, and it offers nothing new to help it stand on its own. It‚Äôs really disappointing how much this volume takes a great character and a great story and just drops all that made it good in favor of... darkness for darkness sake?

"Decent hardware, NOT stolen software (revision): The computer works fine. It was clean, started right up, and had no issues with the hardware.<br />However, the Windows 10? It is a pirated copy, evidently, and it costs, according to Micro Squash, 199 dollars to buy a license. So, the $200 computer becomes the same price as a brand new, warrantied, and legal computer, that runs twice as fast.<br />There is a constant watermark in the lower right hand corner reminding me that the Windows 10 I have has not been activated. Maybe that is why the current upgrades have been loading for the last 5 hours, with no sign of success. I would cautiously recommend purchasing from this seller.<br />Well, a little piece of paper with some information on it would have certainly helped. Hour or so of research online, and i found what I needed to know. 5.8 hours, no exaggeration, of upgrading by MicroSquash, and the Fall Creator Windows 10 was finally loaded, MS recognized the installed software, and all is well.There is actually a Windows 10 sticker on the bottom that has the code on it. Be sure to have a magnifying glass handy if you need to read it.<br />Note: if you get this laptop, which I would now recommend, put tape securely over the airplane mode switch on the right side of the case.

"The Daredevil and Richter's Band: I happened to find an article last night...actually, since I Google the name ""Gergiev"" in Latin and Cyrillic about every 24 hours, ""happened"" is stretching it, so let's just say I found, in the Times Online, a very nice review of the LSO's performances of Shostakovitch in Vilnius and St. Petersburg last week under the baton (or toothpick, chopstick, whatever he was using that night) of their principal conductor-elect.  The writer, Richard Morrison, noted that at the first rehearsal, a musician had to stand at the podium because the maestro was 90 minutes late (due to the thirteen other projects he is working on this week), and at the second, Gergiev suddenly decided to dispense with rehearsal altogether after a half hour. ""Rehearse? Too hot to rehearse.  I know important people at Hermitage.  You'll have VIP tour.""  On both nights, the concert was terrific and the Shostakovitch-wise Russian crowds gave standing ovations. A relief, no doubt, but did the LSO know what they were getting into, Morrison wondered,  when they let this crazy Osettian sign on the dotted line?<br /><br />The answer apparently lies in this box.  Gramaphone magazine says it got Gergiev the job, after he and the LSO recorded it under the auspices of his home label, at the Barbican.  Both parties, Gergiev and the musicians, have said this collaberation felt like a good artistic fit and definitely wanted to do more together. And the results are exciting, emotional in places, and soaring in others.<br /><br />The set contains eight symphonies altogether, two editions of the Fourth symphony (both the 1930 and 1947 version) included. As such, it takes us through the life of a naive prodigy, Prokofiev; full of optimism and hope, who ends up with a sad and tortured life, but yet hanging on to the hope.<br /><br />To me the most beautiful and ""accessible"" symphonies here are #1 and the original #4, the latter of which is based on the ballet, ""The Prodigal Son.""  Especially as it is played here, I had a hard time getting past the first movement of the 1st symphony to listen to the others...it is a thrill to hear the first motif climb to that as the clarinet joins in; then at about 1:39 a second motif sweeps over like a wave. And as usual, when Gergiev is ""on"" he seems to bring something extraordinary out of the musicians he works with.  The range from piano to fortefortissimo seems greater, there is a greater sense of joy, especially in the earlier works.<br /><br />The latter works are much more tricky.  There are layers of mystery as to what Prokofiev was trying to convey.  He'd been punished for not being (-insert Stalin's artistic complaint of the day-) enough, although he'd been thrown a few bones since. In the meantime, he'd lost his wife (the notes say ""left for younger woman"", but other sources have the authorities annulling Prokofiev's marriage to his foreign wife and encouraging his relationship with the politically correct Mira Mendelson).  Broken, exiled from his home in Leningrad, ill, he will die a year after the 7th is written.  How to characterize these mood swings, and the cynicism, not forgetting to leave out the hope?  The orchestra does it.  Gergiev does it.  There is a clarity here that brings each note, each brush on the canvas to light.<br /><br /> And it might seem strange, but somehow it comes from this pairing of Vladivazkaz' Evel Knievel and  some musicians from the land of ""pardon me, please, and thank you"" and ""no sex please, we're British.""<br /><br />Rotterdam doesn't seem to have fared any the worse for their association with Gergiev. (To the contrary).  Prokofiev could definitely use more of the Gergiev-LSO collaberation. The next three years will undoubtedly bring some sparks.  Ladies & gentleman, tune your instruments & fasten your helmets! This is going to be quite a ride.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Here's what they're looking like in 2018: OK so I read all the problems mentioned by other shoppers.  Here's what they're looking like in 2018.  The curtains look decent when you take them out of the package.  I got lucky in that it did not have the horrible smell some mentioned or damage.  However, the hem along both sides and the bottom looks cheap.  Just not done well.  Also, luckily, the curtains were not metalic....the cream pattern just has a little sheen but it looks fine. But the thing that makes these curtains a joke is that when you hang them over a window, the pattern completely disappears where light shines though but then reappears at the bottom and sids where there is no window.  So anywhere the light is shining through, there is absolutely no pattern.  They become, cheap (for me) tan curtains.  Also, it's not a heavy material.  It's thin.  I am going to move them from the window and use them as a &#34;door&#34; to two walk in closets (so no light will shine through) but not what I bought them for.",1.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

"Noteworthy Resource: It's interesting that books on fieldwork tend to exclude extended discussions of note-taking as a part of fieldwork.  The focus of many guides on fieldwork methods usually is on completing audio or video interviews and on the use of photography in fieldwork.  This book fills this gap in research methodology.  The writers show good, practical techniques for taking notes during ethnographic and oral history field research.  More importantly, they convincingly demonstrate how creating good fieldnotes is essential to completing good ethnographic studies.  Each section of the book blends practical ideas with theoretical generalizations in ways that not only show readers how to complete field research, but the discussion also reveals why these techniques are useful.  The chapter that provides ways to turn fieldnotes into written ethnographies is an especially helpful discussion of a challenging task.  In this particular chapter, and in the book in general, readers can find ideas that can also be applied to the use of other field-generated resources such as structured audio/video interviews and photo sessions.  This book is also valuable as a resource for understanding and examining various written ethnographic studies.  In this respect, the insights offered by Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw give readers good ideas for evaluating written ethnographies and useful perspectives for understanding the process of completing ethnographically-grounded research and how ethnographic study contributes to the representation of culture.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Excellent Coffee For The Connoisseur: I was totally spoiled long ago with that Awesomely Hard To Find, and most perfectly black Espresso Roast one always gets at a True.. Italian Restaurant.. when I went to work for Gloria Jean's Coffee Bean back in 1990. The lady under whom I worked was not only a former childhood neighbor, but also had actually studied coffee in college.. While I found this fact a bit unusual.. She knew a tremendous about about it and passed a lot on to me.. That first cup of proper Italian Espresso spoiled me for life..<br /><br />I am very well known for my incredible and decadent Cappuccinos and Mochas and so on.. I have had many, many blends and types from all over the world ...  From Jamaica Blue Mountain, to Kenya AA ---to Sumatra Mandheling to Vietnamese and even East Timorese roasts, and of course the inimitable and most fantastic Hawaiian Kona...  Coffee is my passion...  Between working at Gloria Jean's in the past and the other fact of half of my family travelling all over the globe and always sending me deluxe coffees.<br /><br />I will never forget that very first cup of Jo... I had never had coffee before, and said to myself, "" Well?? If I am going to work at a "" Proper "" coffee shop.. I had better try it and possibly even learn to like/love it... So... If we are going to do this.. I am going to have the biggest, strongest, toughest, most potent and AWESOME coffee possible...<br /><br />So... we set that wonderful 5' tall grinder to Turkish ( heh ) and triple packed the basket (extra-firmly).. We then put it on that wonderful old Brass and Copper - Three Dome Gaggia with the Brass Eagle on top ( You all know the one ) and turned that bugger on... OOOOOOOHHHHHMG!!! HAHHAAHAHAH The machine started vibrating.. Pressure went up to just over 16lbs.. the over-pressure valves were tweeting just a bit and steam was going everywhere.. and the coffee was coming out like muddy syrup!! HAHHAHA We were all scared it was going to E'Splode!!, but it made it!!! and I had my very first cup of coffee ever..<br /><br />I looked at that cup of charcoal tar coffee * chuckles * and remembered Diana on "" Waiting For God ""  and said, "" 14 Sugars... Please Tom! "" HAHAH ( In retrospect... these days I drink it strong and black, or with a bit of cream only ) I held my nose and tossed back that cup in one gulp and it really wasn't all that bad... Too sweet really, but I liked it... I came out from behind moments later, and then all of a sudden... it happened... The Coffee HIT!!! and I felt my first flush of jojo... I started laughing... and laughing... and just sliiiiiiid down the cases to the floor... laughing for almost 8 minutes... I was done from that point on... Forever in love with Kaffee!<br /><br />Caf√© has been my number one beverage ever since, and I have made it my business to know as many blends and types as I can.. The Italians know coffee.. the heart of coffee.. better than anyone, in my opinion... They did... come up with Espresso and Cappuccino.. after all... but obtaining the sacred black roast is most difficult...<br /><br />The Italian Fellow below by the name of Walter is very correct about this coffee, as is Josie.. This is the REAL-DEAL Super Espresso roast.. It is an acquired taste... If you truly are passionate about super strong proper Italian Espresso/Cappuccino - etc.. Then this coffee is for you.. If you want lighter, but full flavor then go Gran Crema.. Lighter than that then either Crema & Aroma, or Super Crema... all of them are good... I personally.. have really wanted my True Italian Super Roast back for many many years.. This is One Cup Will Do You coffee... Please be sure you have it with food...<br /><br />I hope you all also enjoyed the most precious memory of my very first coffee.. It is a cherished one that still makes me laugh to this very day..<br /><br />Namaste...<br /><br />Au.",5.0,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,1,14

"Almost Perfect-plus: Quick Update:  My son accidentally jumped in the pool with it on and it didn't die.  Bonus points for that!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1:  The app is mostly straightforward and easy to figure out, given that it is clearly a translation to English.  I played around pushing buttons to figure out almost everything.  There are 1 or 2 settings I am still not sure about.  Even so, it is a million times better than a previous one I used.<br /><br />2:  The watch works, basically.  I turned it on and all the included apps function.  I was able to download a few of the optional apps, as well.  (I mention this because a previous one I purchased elsewhere did not.  The camera said ""app not found.""  That was VERY frustrating. )  The location is off a bit, but the sim card I currently have in it seems to be connecting to the nearby Canadian tower.  (We live right on the border with Canada.)  However, I have it connected to our home wifi so I don't know why that isn't overriding the cell tower location.  However, while I LIKE the location watching, my primary concern is to give my son a way to call me without giving him a phone.  He can wear this when he is riding his bike or walking down to the pool and if he needs me, he can call.<br /><br />3:  It is not quite as tween-looking as I had hoped, but is not as ""baby-ish"" as the previous cell watch I had given him to use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1:  There is SOME difficulty in figuring everything out.  I had set up wifi on the watch, but the app said it wasn't connected to wifi.  I added it in the app and then it acknowledged it.  There is a setting in the app marked ""Push Switch"" that I have NO clue what to do with.  It only comes with a basic getting started manual.  It will, indeed, get one started, but does not go into any details after that.<br /><br />2:  The chat feature only allows VERY short typed messages from a parent.  I have not yet determined how long a voice message can be.<br /><br />3:  The start-up sound is extremely loud and rather childish.  This is the ONE area where I prefer the previous watch.  The old one sounds like a standard android device starting up.  (It, too, was obnoxiously loud, though.)  I just cover the speaker with my finger until it is done.<br /><br />4.  I wish there were a way to turn off he ""watch has been removed"" alert.  Yesterday, my son did take it off several times and maybe just pulled it away from his skin to let it breathe for a second.  Also, it seems like it would be useful to have it also tell me watch is back on.  If it ONLY tells you when it has been taken off, you can't know if they remembered to put it back on!<br /><br />5:  This, by far, is the biggest con for my family and our needs.  YOU MUST TAKE THE WATCH OFF WHEN SWIMMING!  They call it ""waterproof,"" but it is only water resistant.  My kids spend the summer at our town pool between swim lessons, open swim time, and swim team practice.  They walk or ride their bikes there.  THIS is what I want the watch for.  Last year one watch ultimately died because one child jumped in forgetting to take it off.  Another time she remembered to take it off and left it there.  Fortunately, it was still there when she went back.  Another time she went to the store, but didn't bother to put it back on, so IT was at the pool but she wasn't.  And these instances are exactly what I don't want to have to worry about.  However, I have found NO 4G kids watches that are swimproof, so that certainly doesn't make this watch any worse than the next.<br /><br />In all, I am happy with this purchase so far.  However, I definitely need a swimproof one for my daughter, which means shelling out bigger bucks for an adult watch (and hoping she doesn't lose my $200 investment üòú).",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Great look, not quite as functional: I purchased this cookie cutter more as a gift/joke than as an actual tool, but I used it so I can speak to its' functionality.  The cutter is nicely made, same quality as most tin cutters. You will have to store in tissue away from anything that will bend it as it is very thin, but that is what you get when you purchase a tin cutter.<br /><br />When using, the arms are so thin that the dough can not stay together (I am semi-pro cook and have made sugar cookies on sticks, toothpicks and in every shape color and size, so I am well versed in dough and using cutters). I had to bend open the arms a bit and this made the crawfish look a bit odd, but once iced, they were the hit of the party.<br /><br />The cutter looks great tied to a package ( I used it to adorn the top of a thank you gift for a crawfish boil) and works OK as a cutter making slightly mis-shapped crawfish due to the thin arms. Like I said, we covered with red flow icing, and put candy eyes on each one and they were a hit at a crawfish boil.<br /><br />I bought 3, used one for cookies and gave 2 tied to thank you gifts.

"I'm buying again: I love coffee and always selected medium-dark roast, but really need to branch out to lighter roasts.

Maybe not #1, but there was no consistent #1 on any lists, but this coffee did make all the lists. And, it doesn't list the flavor profile of chocolate (which I dislike). So I tried it - big move for someone who doesn't like change. I used pour over. The coffee is great! It was a real mouth explosion. BUT, I did learn a couple of things. 1. Grind the beans really coarse. 2. Do not use the Hario filters since they a have a coating on them and it did not drain well. I have some cheap V60 filters and they worked great!<br /><br />This coffee did not make me jittery and I love it in the afternoon. I will be buying again.

"College relationship?: I thoroughly enjoyed reading Where We Left off. Parrish wrote the book as an old-school first person novel: one character, Leo, tells the complete story. In my opinion, authors can sometimes get so carried away writing first person from several perspectives, that it becomes confusing. Although I know from personal experience that multiple first person perspectives can sometimes make telling a story easier. Anyway, this book definitely isn't a cookie-cutter M/M romance. I found it to be very satisfying!<br /><br />This book is the third in a series. It is definitely a stand alone novel, though I think having read book one of the series beforehand would add to the reading enjoyment of Off. I enjoyed the development of the main and secondary characters. I felt like Leo could easily be an actual college student in his first year at NYU. The portrayal of college life was believable and the New York City setting was perfect. The editing is spot-on.<br /><br />It is easy for me to recommend Where We Left Off to readers who enjoy this genre, and who are looking to read a well-written book!",4.0,Unknown,1,32

""Max On Life"" is safe ground.  No one is going to make fun of you for asking any question.  No one is going to whisper about you after the question is asked.

"Not for Bettas: I had hoped that this would work for my bettas. If you do get it for a betta, you will need to do a LOT of manipulating to get the air flow slow enough so the fish isn't blown all over the tank. I was able to get one of these to work in a 3-gallon tank but had to turn it off in my 5 gallon tank.<br /><br />Before anyone says I didn't set it up correctly, I use the same sponge filter, return valve, and tubes for both tanks. I put an additional sponge in both sponge filters to slow the bubbles even further. This was enough for the three gallon on the lowest setting but didn't work for the 5-gallon.<br /><br />For the 5 gallon, I also installed an air stone and an air release valve with the hopes that it would slow the airflow down. Unfortunately, my betta would just sit in the farthest corner away from the filter as he was exhausted from trying to swim in the high currents. Once I turned off the filter, he was much more active and even built a bubble nest. I'm tired of trying to find ways to get this filter to work correctly so I will just clean the tank more often while looking for an alternate air pump.<br /><br />In the end, the cheap price isn't worth the additional work and doodads to get this to function for bettas.",2.0,Pet_Supplies,0,26

The descriptions themselves are rather confusing and not very useful once you've gone to the trouble to find them. The writing is overall rather poor, as this sentence from the back cover (and it begins a paragraph): &#34;Coverage of this topic is currently lacking in the market in that the statement can be made that it has never been attempted on this level of extensive coverage over the entire sky before.&#34; There are lots of minor grammatical errors and odd capitalizations (Zenith), so it badly needed a proofreader. Half the book is double-spaced! What a waste of space. The pages are too small for the illustrations. There are a few interesting descriptions (eg. McNeil's Nebula in M78) but the organization -- or severe lack of it -- renders the book virtually useless, especially at the telescope.",1.0,Books,0,7

The major problem I have is the auto sleep function turns the flash off every five minutes or so no matter what.

"Bosch Brought to Life. Titus Welliver as Bosch, an L.A. Detective Who Just Wants to Work the Case and His Great Team Beside Him.: If you enjoy the Michael Connelly Bosch series novels, you will love Amazon's Bosch TV series. Amazon got it right. The production value is high. The pacing is perfect. Titus Welliver as the haunted, resourceful, tenacious Bosch marinates in angst and moves from the past to the present, as he tries to color inside the lines and solve homicides. He leads a fine set of actors.  Each cast member, from major to minor characters are embodied by seasoned actors that you will recognize when you watch the series, which is supremely addictive: Amy Aquino, Lance Reddick, Troy Evan, Scott Klace, Jamie Hector, Rose Rollins, Sarah Clark... Special congratulations to Jason Gedrick. He brings to life the psychopath Raynard Waits and gives a subtle, deep performance. Jason Gedrick is a much underutilized actor. I have seen him play nice and the opposite, and he needs more roles. He is a great family guy and successfully raised three sons. Titus Welliver is a landscape painter, too. I think all of the actors in this series are multi-dimensional people while not acting, and they bring their life experiences with them and it shows. Excellent series, 5 Stars. Congratulations, Amazon, great job bringing to life a Bosch novel. I hope we see more adaptations of Michael Connelly's Bosch novels with this fine cast and crew.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Not a good book.: When I first looked at this book I was purchasing it for a class. I saw that about half of the people rated as 5 stars which is about 50%""ish"" of the total ratings. It seems like a lot of books on the topic of LA get tough reviews so I didn't consider purchasing supplemental study material like I do for most other classes. After studying this book and figuring out how much I hate it, I started trying and figure out why so many people like this book. I discovered that 3 people were actually rating the seller, not the text itself.<br /><br />So here is what I don't like about this book.<br />  There is a proof is section 3.2 for a vector subspace of polynomials. Using their same logic for their proof on showing the defined problem was not a subspace, you could also disprove everything they claimed to be a subspace. The author also defines problem using fictional methods of addition and multiplication for the sake of a proof which doesn't help me understand the topic. It's hard to explain, but there is a lot of irrelevant examples. This isn't actually in the book but I feel like a lot of the examples are posed in the context if ""If 2 + 2 = 5"" .... Well 2+2 is never = to 5 so why are we even discussing it to show how something fails under given properties. I feel like the proofs fail during the initial statement therefore it was point to begin with. There are several examples where you see stuff like A = s[a+b], T(A) = [sa+b]. Again, this is not possible so why are we discussing this as a proof? I just can't find the logic in this book.<br /><br />  If you have a choice, I would recommend Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-Edition by David Lay. It still has a lot of the mathematic rigor. The book was also written with in the last decade so it familiar when you are reading it. The big thing that I like he shows you how linear algebra is applicable. I can now balance a chemical equation using Gauss-Jordan row reduction which makes total sense.",1.0,Books,0,7

"Great help ‚Äì‚Äì even if you aren't a birder: The state of Texas has more different species of birds than any other state, in part due to the annual migrations that buzz through on their way to summer breeding grounds. I am not a birder, but enjoy bird photography. The big problem for me is trying to find the birds to photograph. I would rather had a GREAT picture of an ordinary bird than to have a bad picture of a really exotic bird. The Birder's Guide to the Texas Coast is a really useful guide to finding the birds here. My wife and I just came back from the coast and found the guide particularly helpful. We needed all the help we could get. Ponds that were full of the birds when Holt wrote his book are now dry dirt because of the extended drought. The habitats have been severely damaged.

"New Dell battery, great price, easy to install: The battery that came with my Dell Inspiron 13 suffered a ""permanent failure,"" which meant I needed to replace it. The Dell folks were not helpful. At first they directed me to a Dell battery for a different model, which I wasn't sure was compatible. Then they said they could sell me a refurbish one like the one I had for $164, which just seemed ridiculous. Found this new Dell battery on Amazon, and it is compatible with my specific model. Arrived the next day. Took 5-10 minutes to install, only because I was being super-careful with the tiny screws that hold the laptop cover on (9 screws) and the 4 tinier screws inside the case that hold the battery on to the motherboard. I am not a computer geek but this was very easy. Works fine, happily charging. No idea how long it will last, but my computer is happy so I am.

"Modern Day Pride & Prejudice with Spice: I truly enjoyed this book. Megan was a hoot and, as the original P&P has always been one of my favorite reads, it was such fun trying to figure out who was the current counterpart to the original. Also, having lived in Dallas since 1997 and spending near 2 decades being a club soccer mom, the setting was very near to my heart.<br /><br />How unique to see the juxtaposition of soccer and debutantes! I know the Dallas soccer world intimately but found the entire deb scene to be of great interest as I have never ‚Äòbeen there, done that‚Äô,  - I can easily imagine such being true. When I first moved to the Big D I was told my hair was not pouffy enough and that ladies dressed (hair, make up, outfits - the whole 9 yards) to go to the grocery store.<br /><br />Rumour has it that SMU (Southern Methodist University) is one of the top choices for college of this set. I have heard that a woman attending and wanting to be part of the social scene had better be wealthy as they lunch  at top restaurants in the neighborhood near daily‚Ä¶.  And yes, the $$$$ spent on clothing is outrageous. Dallas abounds with consignment stores selling gowns that have been worn 1x by these women, but there is an increasing frequency of holding auctions of these gowns to raise additional funds for charity.<br /><br />Back to the book, some of the special scenes I loved were of Megan and Ann. I truly enjoyed Ann and how she and Megan came together over the course of their interactions. It seemed to me that a real turning point for Megan was when she was washing the exquisite china that Anne used to serve tea, and Megan suddenly saw how precious and fragile the pieces were. I feel as though Megan became a woman that day.  I also loved that Anne attended Megan‚Äôs soccer game ‚Äì the 2 worlds saw insight into each other‚Äôs spheres and came out the better for it.<br /><br />The only thing I regret is that The Season was not longer. I would have loved more dialogue between Megan and Anne, and Megan and Andrew ‚Äì some more extended verbal sparring would have been fun as the characters developed over the events at hand, as well as growing insight into their increasing affection and respect for each other. The uncovering & resolution of Hank‚Äôs underhandedness seemed a tad rushed to me, and minimized the suspense and magnitude of social ruin faced by the family.  Nevertheless,  I was sorry when I finished the book, - I wanted more and am now hoping for a sequel!!<br /><br />PS One item about the soccer world: in high school at least, the parents are as intimately involved as the players for Club Soccer. It is a family undertaking, with moms & dads shouldering much of the work for travel and tournament logistics, as well as the entire uniform ordering process. Practice is 4-5x per week, with games virtually every weekend. The soccer season starts in June with tryouts for teams (players do not necessarily stay with 1 team every year), and then in August with tryouts for competitive divisions. That means players are practicing in 100+ degree heat all summer, 2x per day. Once the season starts, every weekend is consumed with games. The season goes until May. Most competitive players also play high school soccer as well. Over the holidays there are road trips to compete against teams in other states. Your life is controlled by the soccer schedule! This being said, college soccer is equally intense from what I have heard, and for Megan to try to handle both soccer and deb commitments is truly impressive if not an act of folly for a normal human!",5.0,Books,1,7

"Not sure I received what I ordered, package was open and seems light duty for a 110 lb. dog: This is the first retractable dog leash I have purchased and thought it would be easier than using my current 20 ft. long leash that gets tangled and dirty dragging behind my dog.  I assumed (and one should never assume) the leash was a nylon flat belt style but it is a cord, I did not see any specs that would have described the actual leash.  Although I will use it I am a bit skeptical about the strength, I bought the Large for dogs up to 110 lbs.  My dog is just under 70 lbs. but likes to pull so I will update this after I have some experience with it.<br /><br />The package was open inside the envelope when it arrived and there were no instructions on how to lock or unlock the brake, just trial and error until you figure it out.  It doesn't appear to be a used item but since the blister package was open and apparently taped closed I wonder if it was a return.  The unit has the brand name &#34;Amazing Dog Leash&#34; and a disclaimer label that states &#34;NEVER allow the cord/tape to become wrapped around fingers, hands, arms, legs, etc  The cord/tape can cut or burn you or another person&#34;  No other markings on the unit, no indication of the size and since the package was open I just hope what I received is the Large for 110 lb. dogs.  Other brands for large (over 100 lb.) dogs seem to all have a tape style leash that would appear stronger than the cord and since the disclaimer clearly states &#34;cord/tape&#34; one can only assume (there's that word again) that some models of the brand &#34;Amazing Dog Leash&#34; have the tape.",3.0,Pet_Supplies,0,26

"Engaging tale that kept me up two night until I finished reading: In Liars and Thieves, Diana built a believable world of three races and three characters representing each. The goblins dwelt in the mountains. They were terrakinetic, a skill in their possession in manipulating, moving, and transforming rocks and minerals into altered shapes, into alloys, into machinery. The elves lived in the river plain but invaded the changeling‚Äôs territory when cutting trees. The changelings inhabited in the jungle in human form but could shift into animals and insects, known for being thieves and spies.<br /><br />Borderland was a common area where the Council meets. The Council leadership comprised of nine members‚Äîthree representatives from each race. All races were free to live and work and die in the Borderland. The Veil in the far north held the secrets of eternity. It divided the Known World of the three races to the unknown. Those who had attempted to cross through had never returned. The common denominator for all three races was the crystals. The goblins mined them, elves needed them to power their weapons and homes; and changelings used them to shift shapes.<br /><br />The three main characters were: Naj, the half-elfin, half goblin, used reasoning to make decisions. Alue, an elf who was impulsive, made mistakes at every turn. Talin, the changeling, gained the queen‚Äôs favorite by being her spy.<br /><br />After building the foundation of the fantasy world, Diana skillfully unfolded the chaos and resolution-seeking among the races and the characters. Over the years, the explosion in the north collapsed the mine. Some members from all three races disappeared, but there were no remains. Each race was suspicious over the others for killing their kinds and stealing the crystals. When Naj, Alue, and Talin questioned by their leaders, they selected and omitted details to report only what the leaders wanted to hear. Individually, these three were not enemies to each other. They acted on the commands of their leaders. During trials, when one was in danger of being executed, the other tried to extend the defense. As reflected in the actual world, these races tried to form an alliance with one race to go against the other. When circumstances changed, they retreated and changed their mind to protect their own interest.<br /><br />Diana skillfully made her imagination visible in the lines such as:<br /><br />‚ÄúWaves bulged along the Veil‚Äôs magnetic lines like sound along an instrument‚Äôs string.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúThe elders leaned toward each other, their murmured comments passing to the ends of the arc and back like ripples in a pond.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúThe ancient goblins gasped as Naj‚Äôs skull flattened and muzzle protruded, baring deadly canines. His limbs shuddered and contracted. Shoulder blades and hip bones tilted as his body contorted on the floor and spine lengthened. Joints tore apart and reformed into new connections.‚Äù<br /><br />I developed a personal liking for the characters and wanted to know what happened to them next.

"Bold Brew for the Win: Cup of Joe is a super sweet and fluffy read with a decent age gap and a nice Daddy/boy relationship between Joe and Levi. There are a host of supporting characters that will set up other books in this series. I liked how Levi's character fought to maintain his independence instead of just falling into a Sugar Daddy situation. I liked how their kinks accentuated their relationship instead of defining it.<br /><br />I usually devour books like this, but I just couldn't get into a groove where I felt like the ""buy in"" for this relationship. There was a lot of insta going on, and I felt like the character's feelings were taking place off page and we only got the highlights.<br /><br />I look forward to the rest of the series, although I am hoping for a bit more out of them than a fluffy marshmallow, but that's just me!<br /><br />If you are looking for a super sweet, fluffy, low-angst, mild on the kink, but generous on the steam and heat story, than this is a good read to check out!<br /><br />**I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

You can play it in a ""simple"" mode, and as you gain experience, go for the ""full"" mode. My son and his friends play a ""custom"" set of rules..it is adaptable.<br /><br />For a 10 yr old boy, this is a good board game that gets the players talking to each other, they can play for awhile, then go off and play basketball, then come back to Heroscapes...........Which is good, because a full game can take hours.......<br /><br />I would never have bought Heroscape sets if my son did not rave about it for days and weeks on end.

"The challenges of the factional approach: I have found it extremely difficult to review this book, and most particularly to only be able to 3 star it, when its subject matter is so very important.<br /><br />Sometimes, we absolutely do need to be harrowed, reminded that the nightly, often dehumanising stories which seek to divide migrants into the worthy ‚Äì fleeing immediate war torn zones (Syria, Iraq) and the ‚Äòunworthy‚Äô ‚Äì ‚Äòeconomic migrants‚Äô are heinous divisions. Particularly as those ‚Äòeconomic‚Äô migrants are often undertaking desperate, dangerous journeys to cross the seas on over-crowded, unseaworthy craft, literally risking their lives, in impossible conditions, paying over the odds to cynical people traffickers.<br /><br />We need to remind ourselves that taking these journeys from parts of the world, where  politics, climate change, famine, present or prior conflicts and the like, are not doing this from some kind of idle choice. Every single denizen of the world would want a better life for themselves. I would not risk my life on such a journey because I am lucky enough to have been born in a time and place where my own life choices are not between savage rocks and very hard places. There is always food on my table, and I live my life without danger ‚Äì through no virtue of my own, merely through a lucky accident of birth.  Many are not so fortunate<br /><br />I wanted to read this account to remind myself of who the people are who make these journeys, and why, and that those papers who whip up the dreadful ‚Äòunworthy economic migrants‚Äô populism stories are knowingly callous and fostering fear, hate and callousness.<br /><br />So.this is an important book. Lampedusa is one of the small Mediterranean islands which, because of proximity to places such as Eritrea, are being left to shoulder impossible burdens which other farther away, First World countries are not really engaging with.<br /><br />‚ÄòThe optician of Lampedusa‚Äô is the real story of a group of friends who made a difference to 47 people they dragged, dying, from the sea. Another small craft some time previously had ignored the dead and dying and sped away, leaving them to their fate<br /><br />My challenge with this book though, is that reporter Kirkby chooses to tell this AS a story. And this actually has the effect of diminishment. The effect, curiously,sanitises and romanticises and misses landing the punches which would have happened had she written this as reportage, directly quoting what that group of ordinary people who did NOT pass by on the other side, said, did and thought. It did not need to be ‚Äòmade literature of‚Äô I think the literature approach, in this instance, does a kind of disservice to the events<br /><br />I compared this with a far more powerful, also harrowing book I read about Chernobyl, again, by a reporter, [[ASIN:B004N257H2 Svetlana Alexievich‚Äôs Chernobyl Prayer. ]] Alexievich chose to let the contributors tell their own stories. That kind of immediacy does not allow the reader any kind of get-out, or luxury of thinking any of it may be ‚Äòspin‚Äô Turning events into ‚Äòfaction‚Äô Is more likely to mean the book is read as ‚Äòreal‚Äô only by the already converted, but that those who want to believe that ‚Äòeconomic migrants‚Äô have some kind of real choice, will find it easier to dismiss as story.<br /><br />I received this as a review copy from Amazon Vine UK",3.0,Books,0,7

Good for the money.: The sound of this exhaust is amazing. And loud. However the install was a little bit hard for me but I got it done in about 2 hours with some help. Maybe I got unlucky but the headers were a really tight fit and took some work and light taps to get it in. The strap that goes around the muffler is very hard to install because it doesn't like to wrap all the way around the muffler but with some help and needle nose vice grips I was able to get the strap on properly. I noticed some people made a bracket or cut the other side of the strap off to make it work and you do not need to do that. Overall it is great for the price and recommend tuning it after whenever possible for you. Mine is not tuned right now but I dont notice any powerless if anything my bike is a bit more peppy.

"Circle on screen!: It all works good but the location where you use your fingerprint identification there's a circle. It is always there. It is annoying.

Now I just have an annoying circle in the screen. It's always visible but especially when it is dark. It's easy to install but if you're using an Otterbox Defender than you better get that thing put on exactly because mine is off by probably 1/8 of an inch and the bottom of the screen protector isn't seated perfect so I have to press a little harder to actually use the home button, etc. The quality of the protector is good though, so far.",2.0,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0,9

"Great bag, especially for the price, but needs more protection. NO HARD BOTTOM: This is an excellent bag for the price, I'm assuming. The bag is light, has plenty of space and compartments, but not a whole lot of protection for your gear, do not expect this to be the type of bag that you can just sling off your shoulder and plop onto the ground, at least not without adding a little bit more protection yourself. I do really like the straps, they can be customized, as is shown in the product pictures, and the waist strap distributes much of the weight off my shoulders. The quick access compartment is also convenient. And the tripod holder is a plus.<br /><br />Light Bag<br />It's very light. I bought this bag because I'll be on an international flight that has a 12lb weight limit on carry on baggage and I wanted to keep my laptop with me, which already weighs in at about 4-5lbs, plus my camera and lens (another couple pounds). So I needed a light bag and that's what I got.<br /><br />The trade off is less protection. The major issue I have at it, even considering the price, is that there isn't hard plastic bottom or reinforced siding to absorb an impact from the bottom, just a piece of foam. The higher priced bags that I have seen listed on Amazon (never in person), have hard plastic bottoms.<br /><br />The laptop portion is padded a little bit more, but unlike other laptop bags, the portion does not have separate interior padding, exposing it to more direct impacts.<br /><br />In the picture I have just gently pushed in the bottom of the bag with my thumb, to demonstrate just how weak the bottom portion is. I added a piece of cardboard and some air packets, since my gear will still all fit, with them, but I am still very wary.<br /><br />Overall, great bag, especially for the price. It's stylish and functional, and perfect for my needs as a carry on. Will probably find a more rugged bag for urban shooting, where I have to worry about putting the bag down on concrete or having people bump him to me or kick over the bag.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Struggled With This One: I have loved the Trio's music since the beginning. I have all of their albums in vinyl and CD (excluding the cheap compilations). So I was excited when this Rarities disk was released. Unlike many fans I enjoyed the Trios forays into more thoughtful 60s rock and folk. I really like ""New Frontier,"" ""Time to Think"" and ""Children of the Morning"" where John Stewart was obviously trying to move the group in a different direction. This disk is an attempt by the Trio to record more relevant (at the time) message music and you can tell their hearts just weren't in it. Their interpretations were ragged and raw and they hadn't worked out how to infuse the music with the KT voice of soulfulness and energy. It certainly isn't a finished work. More like an experiment abandoned.<br />The cover photo is pretty indicative of the contents. The guys trying to look like a folk/rock group--and failing. Unless you are filling out your collection, avoid this one. There are so many, far better, more representative albums of the Kingston Trio and their music.",2.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,0,8

"Setup is terrible.  They make it overly difficult.: I just got my whistle.  Trying to set it up got me inventing new cuss words.  The app is the problem so far - they put a large ""NEXT"" button on the screen of my cellphone which covers the area of the screen where it shows what I'm typing, so basically I'm typing blind.  This is a problem when entering my router's password.  My fat fingers don't always hit the key I'm aiming for.  Then, going back to redo this step, I go back a couple of screens and it has to find my whistle again, which takes about 5 times longer than the first time it found it!<br />  But editing the map is the worst!  You should be able to do this on your PC.  On your phone it is extremely difficult.  My property is 53 acres, but I couldn't seem to get the safe area squeezed down that small.  I fussed and fussed, the dog staring at me with her ""It's time to take a walk"" look.  Eventually, my clumsy figures inadvertently changed the safe area map from a rectangle to a triangle and the DONE area of the screen!  I hope I can come back and correct this later.  I spent over an hour fussing with this.  I could rant some more, but I'd rather take the dog for our morning walk!",2.0,Unknown,0,32
"Disappointing: I loved loved loved Nobody's Fool. I reread Nobody's Fool 6 times. Maybe that's Everybody's Fool left me a little flat. I reread Empire falls twice. I reread Mohawk and Risk Pool. I loved Bridge of Sighs. I was disappointed in this book. There were moments of humor, but many times things seemed forced. I've read some of the criticism of Mr. Russo's work- the lack of strong female characters, the lack of diversity in general. This book seems to answer some of those criticisms, but comes across as work not as pleasure. Some of the usual Russo themes are there many of which I don't completely understand- disabled and abused children, wayward fathers, the role of luck in the world. Sully has money in this book and seems bored, so does Mr. Russo. Having said that I still finished the book, because Mr. Russo is a writer whose sentences still go down pretty easy.",3.0,Books,0,7

Right from the beginning there is always something going on. It is an emotional roller coaster ride for you as you read, it is great. With constant turns it kept me on the edge of my seat. Another aspect that I loved was the two main characters! Oh my goodness, they were adorable! The characters overall were great. They were well developed and had unique qualities to them. Rhonda was able to portray them so you fall in love, or hate, with the character. It really ensures you want to continue reading the next book in the series.<br /><br />  With a Hunger Games type vibe from the end of the book, I would recommend this book. If you like: action, intrigue, drama, time travel, dynamic characters, strong plot and constant twists, this book is for you!",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Great transition from sleeping in arms only to bed-side cosleeper: Our little one was a baby who couldn't sleep outside of our arms or in a more upright position (bouncer, car seat). He also seemed distressed when I tried to put him to sleep in our bed-side Arms Reach cosleeper. I assumed that it felt huge and wide-open to him after the safety of our arms. I was concerned that he was not able to sleep flat on his back, and I was afraid I'd never get any sleep, so I got this cosleeper to try to transition him to sleeping alone and flat. It worked like a charm!<br />The mattress/pad in this cosleeper ‚Äãis light weight, so I got creative: my little one falls asleep while nursing, so I put the cosleeper mattress on top of my Boppy nursing pillow while my son ate (I made sure he was basically on his back while feeding). When he fell asleep, I carefully transferred him, cosleeper mattress and all, to the cosleeper frame, ensuring he was on his back. (I kept the frame right next to me while nursing.)  After a few days of this, I was able to transfer him without using the mattress. I would swaddle him to make sure he didn't wake from the Moro reflex.<br />The SwaddleMe cosleeper was used inside of our Arms Reach bed-side co sleeper, so when I felt like my son was outgrowing the SwaddleMe cosleeper, I easily transitioned him into the Arms Reach. Once again, I got creative and removed the little mattress from the frame and put baby on the mattress inside the bed-side cosleeper, because he was used to that softness/feeling of the SwaddleMe mattress pad. He slept like that for two nights, then transitioned‚Äãto the big &#34;wide-open&#34; feeling Arms Reach bed-side cosleeper.<br />I used this product a little unconventionally, but it worked!<br />I also folded it down and used as a travel bassinet when visiting friends.

"Disappointed by cast: update: the set I got , Part IX and XI  (9 and 11) were reversed. Was kind of confusing until I did a search<br />and figured it out. The two discs are mislabeled.<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed by the lack of the original cast. (From Winds of War) Almost none of the original cast returned, with just a few that did. So far, (I'm only on the third disc), short cameos of the original cast, but heavy on the new cast. Not too sad about Ali McGraw not being there, she wasn't that good IMO, but the others not being back I felt was a huge error.<br />That being said, the movie seems so far to be pretty good.<br /><br />A bit heavy on the holocaust, and therefore difficult to watch knowing it happened to thousands of Jews, but it DID happen and should be included no matter how hard it is to watch.<br /><br />I just had to take a break from watching, but will go back and finish it later.<br /><br />Just sorry more of the original cast was not involved in this...they were SO good! And I got invested in them and their different plights.<br />Not so much interested in Byron now it's being played by Hart Bochner....not a fan.<br /><br />And Jane Seymor isn't as tough as the character was played by Ms.McGraw, although her acting is better.<br />I also think the original Hitler was better....he just seemed so much more....well, more.

"Waste of Money: I bought this product so I could charge my Galaxy S10+ and my watch Samsung Galaxy 44mm watch at the same time.  I can't use it for my watch because the watch gets so hot that you can barely touch it to take it off.  The watch even shows a warning display after only a few minutes of being on the charger.  As for the phone, it charges it but it's as slow as molasses to charge AND the ENTIRE time it's on the charger it CONSTANTLY disconnects and reconnects (with and without the case on it) and is CONSTANTLY beeping because of the connection going in and out .  I ended up removing the cord and just plugging my phone into my computer and it charges the right way very quickly.  I don't even use the dock anymore.  This was definitely a WASTE of almost $50.  I DO NOT recommend this product.  I do have to say though that when I first got it and I complained about the charger heating my watch, the seller was very quick to respond and try to solve the problem but there is no way to solve this problem without just giving the charger back and getting a refund but, they don't do returns and refunds so this was, without a doubt, LITERALLY a waste of money.",2.0,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0,9

"This Prelude is Upbeat: The opening dialog in dialect is jerky. Once through that into chapters two and three progress is easier. The setting comfortably depicts any performance art practice space I've used. 'Birdy' is quickly established as a gifted but flawed woman, physically and emotionally. It's easy to marvel at the ugliness of her afflictions and the beauty of her sound. I'd have picked more familiar works and arias for the sake of reader familiarity and stronger connection. Alamo's expressions and pace move the story along. The dialog is fitting. The number of people in the studio scene is almost unwieldy but Alamo makes it work by focusing on two or three at a time and Point-of-View isn't compromised. I'd like to read more. Encore.",4.0,Unknown,1,32
"a brilliant thrilling read: This book has everything. From the beginning the reader is hooked and drawn into a world that brings mysticism, terror and a thrill ride that escalates until the last page is turned. The reader tries to keep pace with the central characters and often ends up being turned around as another set of events turns thought on its head and becomes another part in a bigger picture.  The story line takes the reader through a series of events that seem often outlandish but more believable as things move forward towards the conclusion. The characters all add to the events playing out and are all believable in the capacity they play in bringing closure to people affected by one mans madness and grief brought about by his actions.<br /><br />I obtained this book as a Goodreads First Read",5.0,Books,1,7

"As good if not better than expected: So it is finally here, the best band in the world has followed up the fantastic ""In the Wake of Determination"" with their amazing third album. It is everything that I expected, which is a lot, and more.  It has in fact become one of my very favourite albums of all time and I listen to a wide range of music.  It never gets old and I never tire from it.  To me it is a flawless combination of their previous 2 albums.  The guitar sound is sublime, as are Dan's vocals which are accompanied by ridiculously catchy, yet thrashing, yet melodic riffs.  Not one single song is even average but there is still a great deal of variety throughout the album.  To me, this band is destined for greatness but they have been there for a while in my opinion.  I consider it my duty to expose their music to as many ears as possible because it is that good.

"The Story Didn't Add Up: Oh Lordy me! This story could've been so much more than it was! I only continued reading because it was a short, quick read. I'm not too sure of what to say about this story, it wasn't that it was bad, it was just not written with any depth.<br /><br />Andie has gone to Georgia to college, she is living in the sorority house of the Theta Zeta Delta, a group of girls that I would turn on my heel and run as fast as I could from if I saw them coming my way. It centers on their rules and regulations, of what is expected of Andie and whom she can date.<br /><br />That all gets turned on its head when she meets Javier, a mysterious hunk working in the library. It was all well and good, and the premise sounded like we were heading down a very good path. The sisters hated him for who and what he was, a foreigner! A lesser mortal than they were and not in the approved circle of who Andie could step out with.<br /><br />Andie stood her ground and all of a sudden the sisters liked him!! That is until Quinn, the sister's leader found some rather juicy gossip about his family. Then Andie had to dump him, only to get back with him when he explains it away. Don't get me wrong, I wanted them to get back together but everything was a little too perfect. Especially when she realizes ahe cannot stay in the house and leaves, her parents come to town to hep her look for a new apartment. I don't know about you, if my teenage daughter was hooking up with a Colombian drug lord's son I wouldn't be so quick to move into his apartment.<br /><br />It was all so twee and situations righted themselves long before they got out of hand.

I personally wouldn't recommend this brush to anyone other than those with thin fine hair, maybe babies, or men or women that are balding.<br />Not wanting to sound nit-picky but the comb sounds weird in almost an annoying way.

"Different perspective. (Some Minor Spoilers): Overall the movie provides a view into the Mass Effect universe outside of Shepard In a way new to the franchise.  I was overall entertained and found it enjoyable (in spite of myself not being a big fan of Anime), but there were a few things that weren't accurate in game lore, and some things that were just kinda silly.<br /><br />The lore:  As I'm sure others have mentioned there is a scene in which it shows Sovereign being pulled by ships via tow cables at the Citadel.  At the end of Mass Effect 1, it was totally destroyed(Sovereign), parts blown everywhere.<br /><br />The Citadel shown being in orbit around a planet is incorrect, the Citadel is in a nebula.<br /><br />Non-lore related issues I have with the action scenes comprised of things like SMGs being able to blast down ceilings to block paths and a Krogan being able to be brought down by a single pistol/smg shot from behind.<br /><br />As for the story, It was what I was expecting from my knowledge of the lore of the game, so no real surprises, however, the ending was well done and the consequences of choice were illustrated in a dramatic way. I have never been a real Vega-hater to begin with but, this film makes me appreciate the character more (along with Vega's Homeworld comic).<br /><br />There are other really minor nickpicky things that came to mind while watching, which did detract from my viewing, but nothing that should really be held against the film.",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Underwhelming and poorly researched. (Beware spoilers): I picked this up hoping it would be something undemanding to read in the train. Sharon Kay Penman has been writing about the Middle Ages for so long, I thought I could count on a reasonably convincingly medieval setting and hoped for a workmanlike mystery story.<br /><br />Well, it just about passes muster as a murder mystery, but given SKP's career the un-medieval-ness of the setting and the characters' values and behaviour is boggling. She must know perfectly well that in 12th-century society, if the under-sheriff of Hampshire had suggested marrying his peasant mistress everybody - including the mistress - would think he had gone completely mad; that if a rich merchant's son got a foreign pedlar's daughter pregnant, not only would nobody dream that he would or should marry her, nobody would consider it relevant to his arranged marriage; and that the reaction among her neighbours to the murder of a foreign pedlar's daughter who notoriously 'liked men' would be more 'Serve her right, the lustful strumpet' than 'Poor lovely young girl'.<br /><br />The mistakes in the physical setting are as many. SKP must know that there were no 'cottages' in medieval towns, and that even if there had been, the queen's confidential messenger wouldn't rent one to live in  - he would live in her household where she could call on him for duty day or night. That a medieval alewife wouldn't grumble about the badness of the ale her brewer supplied - because would always have brewed and sold her own. And so on, and on.",2.0,Books,0,7

I've found those that stick straight out from your device end up becoming weak in a good connection signal to buds as they tend to become pinched over time and sound starts cutting out if bumped. this L shape end prevents that and keeps the wire closer to the body of the device but still is narrow enough to not prevent use when a device has a case on it.

When it came time for him to fight to finally see this great fighter in action well lets just say it was a let down just like this movie and for some reason there's just moments in the film where the dialogue gooes on for what seem likes minutes of One Nine Four Six Four Nine One Eight Quebec Quebec!

"Terrible t.v: I think it's important for people to realize a few things about this t.v before they buy it.  Yes the price is great for a low end 4k t.v. however what you get is exactlt that, low quality.<br /><br />It's 60hz native refresh rate. That means it will not play 24p judder free. So if you like watching blu rays this is not the t.v for you.<br /><br />The interpolation  is just bad. You will see fragments all over the screen. Its terrible. Not that everyone enjoys the soap opera effect but turning it off again resorts to 60hz that cannot play movies without judder. So you're out of options.<br /><br />But the absolute worst part of this t.v is the panel. Good luck finding one without banding/dse. I went through 4 panels and they all had banding.<br /><br />The only thing it did well was play games because the low input lag. That's all it did well.<br /><br />I won't even mention it doesn't have hdr..you guys know that. I suggest getting a more expensive t.v and don't look back.",1.0,Unknown,0,32
"I am very happy with it: I tried this spot cleaner today and followed the instructions that came with it. Used it to treat calcium scale on a plaster/gunite pool bottom. The scale spots I have on hand are particularly unsightly because their accumulation coincided with an algae problem so it trapped a lot algae-induced greenish-yellowish color within. The tool WORKS. I am very happy with it. It does what it says it would meaning that it releases acid slowly to treat the spot. One load of acid lasts about 10 minutes and is sufficient to clean roughly 1 sq ft.<br /><br />I don't think the tool would work well on pool walls because the acid is heavier than water and would tend to move down and away from the vertical surface. But on horizontal surfaces such as a pool bottom this tool works fine.<br /><br />Now, the only thing I wish I could change about it is the pad size. I would use a larger container, or a tool with 2,3,4 or more containers and a much larger pad, so that it would clean a bigger area faster. As it is, it is great for treating small spots (palm size spots). But if you set out to treat an area of 20-30 square feet as I need to do, then it would take days. I wish I could somehow tie 3 or 4 of these things together to use simultaneously.",4.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,1,25

"Frenetic, inquisitive, and wild--klezmer psychopomp jazz: I wish I knew how to classify this type of music because I love it.  I did my best with the headline.<br /><br />It's psychedelic klezmer-jazz?  I feel like this album represents a vast expressive motif of the buddhist bardo, catholic purgatory, or possibly the process of the alchemical great work from the nigredo to the albedo within the realm of spirits, the proess of becoming in Terence Mckenna's hyperspace.  It's so weird and beautiful, spooky and fun.<br /><br />The album taken as a whole is suggestive of much more under the surface.  A reality beyond our own.  Maybe my perspective is skewed by having been introduced to Orphic Oxtra by this by this off-the-wall youtube video depecting fractal consciousness with the theme song--Skeletons Having Sex on a Tin Roof (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5BdyIGtYcg)<br /><br />In my opinion, the motif of the album vascilates between two polar modalities--one which is manic and productive, ex: being in the Tao versus the other which is melanchoic, mysterious and fearful--spooky.  It belies the danger of facing ones Jungian shadow in the process of the alchemical great work.  It is this psychedelic dualism which comes across to me as an inquisitive exploration of the soul.  The music is so textured, expressive and kaleidescopic--frenetic--that this motif is played out expertly and succinctly.<br /><br />And I hate making this comparison, but I cannot help it: it smacks of elements within the Mr. Bungle cannon; but this is more mature, more klezmer, more jazz and of course without the operatic, profane Mike Patton.<br /><br />I love this album very much. Sorry to some of you for making the mr. bungle comparison. It's where my mind went. I believe if you like mr. bungle--musically or thematically--you'll very much enjoy this album.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

I‚Äôm not big on non-fiction, and to top it all I‚Äôve never been curious or had an interest in octopuses. To say this book surprised me, is an understatement.<br /><br />Sy Montgomery drew me into her account of her time in the world and lives of these amazing sea creatures from the very start. Looking at pictures, and videos on YouTube, of octopuses ‚Äì who resemble sea monsters instead of intelligent beings ‚Äì it is hard to imagine that they can form meaningful relationships with us and solve complex puzzles. But I was mesmerized with Ms Montgomery‚Äôs account of her time with several different octopuses. There were times in this book where I laughed, even wiped away a tear or two, and wholeheartedly wished that I could be as lucky as these individuals who got to know such magnificent creatures so intimately.<br /><br />Overall, this book took me on a journey into an incredible world I never would‚Äôve imagined.

"Some of the best television on television!: I have been a fan of Doctor Who since I started watching re-runs on PBS back in the 1980's. The seasons with David Tennant as The Doctor stack up against any of the seasons from the original run. Tennant very much conveys the fun and quirkiness of Tom Baker as the 4th Doctor while having an edgy, serious, and occasionally dark side as well.<br />This run of episodes features classic Who enemies and introduces the best new enemy in years, the Weeping Angels. &#34;Blink&#34; has to be one of the greatest episodes ever despite hardly featuring The Doctor at all! Daleks, Cybermen, they are all here.<br />I didn't always appreciate the Doctor/Rose relationship angle as I feel The Doctor would be smart enough to avoid those entanglements.

"Saved info for future repurchase: Screen protectors came in a nice little box. When opened, my first thought was that putting the screen protectors on my and my brother's phones was going to be too much for me.<br /><br />There were a lot of peices to the kit but I settled in and pulled out the directions. It took a few minutes but the directions were easy to follow and by the end I had installed my first bubble and dust free screen protector!<br /><br />I have used glass protectors before and can not recommend them enough if you uae your phone all the time like I do for work or you are accident prone (again, like me). This is my first time using this brand, though, and let me tell you. The touch feels so nice, the screen looks shiny like resin, and the home button isnt obstructed at all.<br /><br />Customer service is also great. I got my new protectors in the mail before my phone. The company emailed me to make sure that I hadn't had any issues with installing.<br /><br />My phone had fallen out of my lap and into the driveway once but that is the only test run it has had so far.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"4 out of 5‚≠êÔ∏è: There are so many things I love about this bag. I am a flight attendant and got this because I needed a change in my work bag. Something more stylish. I LOVE that it resembles a Kate Spade purse with the nylon, emblem, and amazing lining. It is very nice quality material inside and out. Lots of pockets and storage. It even has a padded pocket for a lap top.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike as of right now is on the back (both right and left side) there are slight cuts in the piping. It looks to be from where it was folded during shipping but not sure.<br /><br />This alone doesn‚Äôt deter me from liking the bag but just makes me a bit sad as the rest of the bag is so nice.<br /><br />I might exchange it but I need to think about it because I am over all very happy with the bag.

"Great story once i got past my doubts: Honestly I struggled with this book at the start. I couldn't get over the instant love theme. I know love at first sight can happen for some people. But after everything Jordan had been through, it seemed to much like rebound love than real love to me. However I stuck with it because I wanted to know what would happen to our leading couple. And things did turn out for the best.<br /><br />Tom is one lovable cowboy and I just couldn't get enough of him. He was so sweet and reminded me of a big cuddly teddy bear.<br /><br />Oh the added suspense towards the end really helped move this story along since I was so tempted to DNF it. However the mystery of knowing what was going to happen and just wanting to know kept me glued til the very end.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"#HILARIOUSLYSEXYREAD: Ellie Sanders has gotten over the whole fairy tale dreams, after her son's father decided he wants nothing to do with either of them.  Now she's on her own as a single mother, has a successful career of selling Madame Butterfly pleasure aids, and doesn't need, nor want, a man in her life.  However, she and her sister-in-law feel like a hook up, with no strings, is just what the doctor ordered.  Tyler Hendrix had a horrible childhood, so he's positive that love, marriage, and kids aren't in the cards for him.  But his world is thrown out of whack when a super sexy single mother walks through his office doors for his help.  No matter how hard he tries to keep his distance, the more time he and Ellie spend together working, the more his walls come crumbling down.  OMG The Hook Up was hilarious, and I laughed hard enough to snort my way through the book.  Every time the mouth watering Ty would cuss something out, I rolled.  And the mishaps that they suffered along their journey, well, I can't stop saying how hilarious this story was!  And I can't forget to talk about the tiny human too smart for his own good, and the cast of colorful secondaries that only added to the fun.  Tawna Fenske's talented writing style made for a super fun story with an emotional backdrop.  I could have read about Ty and Ellie all night long, so in MY OPINION (&#60;-READ THOSE TWO WORDS CAREFULLY), the ending was a bit too rushed for me.  This author has an original edge in romance, so I never want the stories end.  Anyhow, with all of that being said, I can do no less than HIGHLY RECOMMENDING The Hook Up to everyone!",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Total junk compared to previous model: I had the SB220 for over 4 years before the left speaker just recently shorted out. Other than that, I thought they were excellent headphones given the price point. They had very decent sound and were very comfortable to wear.<br /><br />That being said, I figured I was safe in giving the SB221 a shot. They are definitely not an improvement. First of all, they are not nearly as comfortable. They fit tighter than the 220 did and the ear cushions are not as soft.  Those are things I could live with however as long as they sound decent.  While the overall sound quality is comparable to the 220, the Bluetooth connection is absolutely terrible. Every time I try using these, my connection is completely filled with glitches. Sound is constantly cutting in and out. I‚Äôm using this on an iPhone SE & iPad from a few years ago, and it‚Äôs having issues staying connected to both devices. I‚Äôve updated the software & powered the devices off & on several times, but nothing seems to correct this issue.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I already threw the package away & am outside my return window.  Otherwise I‚Äôd be sending this piece of garbage back. I saw another reviewer said this was a hit or miss item.  I definitely may have just gotten a defective product. However, I‚Äôm not taking the of ordering another set of this brand.

Cole and Madi together are such a cut couple, from the first moment they meet you know they are going to be cute and fun together.<br />Their relationship is about building trust and commitment that every new couple has to have for it to last and be meaningful.The way Cole puts himself out there with thoughtful gifts and poems you see that he is in it and wants it for the long haul and will not give up easily.<br />This is the type of story that you instantly want to fall in love with the characters and can relate a bit to them as well. And in my personal opinion those are one of the best stories to read.<br />I hope you enjoy 90 Proof as much as I did!",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Peace, Love, and Understanding: In a martial arts based action movie, there are a few key aspects to look out for: fight choreography, camerawork, and editing. In all three of these areas, The Raid is a total success. The choreography of the action sequences is truly incredible. The actors themselves are obviously well-trained and their sparring has a stylized yet brutally organic quality to it that makes the fighting all the more engaging. Gareth Evans and his DP's capture the mayhem in a very active sort of way. The camera is always moving and never loses track of where it needs to be. Evans also did a superb job of cutting the film. If the viewer would try to count the number of shots in a single three-minute sparring scene, they would most likely lost track after a hundred. That's not to say the editing is overdone though, just well done. If one looks at The Raid from a narrative/structural standpoint, there's not much to be found. The family angle is a bit contrived, as is the crooked cop angle, but for a film like The Raid that is clearly not trying to break any new ground on the drama front, that's perfectly alright. It does, however, try to be an exceptional martial arts action movie and triumphs gloriously. Bring on the sequel!",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Fantastic Budget Nozzles for Your Average Hobbyist: These nozzles are great for a hobbyist. They work well with PLA, ABS, and any other standard polymers one may be printing. I tried these in an Ender 3 and every size worked well, and fit without issue.

No worries if you need to scrap one and replace it.<br />-A vast variety of sizes, so you can try multiple nozzles to see which parameters work best.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Only two of each nozzle. If you happen to lose one, you need to treasure your remaining one.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great purchase for anyone who is hoping to try a variety of nozzle sizes before they buy a bunch of a particular size. The nozzles are a great price, and are of great quality, especially for them being so disposable at $0.37 apiece.",5.0,Industrial_and_Scientific,1,19

But I can no longer support use of their product until they find another, more humane way, to produce it.  Capturing monkeys and training them often abusively to retrieve coconuts is a practice that needs to stop.  I'm very disappointed that Chaokoh has been involved in this practice while other companies (mostly non-Thai) have found more acceptable ways to produce their product.  The fact that many of our major grocery stores have also decided not to carry the Chaokoh brand is proof that consumers have a voice and the responsibility to use it.",3.0,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,0,14

"The Lady Manages: You can‚Äôt judge a book by its cover. Actually, you can. But it‚Äôs not necessarily going to be an accurate assessment. This cover depicts a man pointing a gun, apparently right at the reader. For me, that engenders a distinct sense of unease. Is he the outlaw in the title or the marshall? A slight glimpse of metal on his left breast might indicate the latter but it‚Äôs too obscured to be certain.<br /><br />Once you force yourself past the implicit threat of the cover, you realize that it‚Äôs an excellent indicator of what lies within the pages of this ‚Äúromance‚Äù. A woman is freed from her outlaw husband with her children and adopted offspring. But the fear left by his years of mistreatment haunts her. It takes a while for her to move past that terror.<br /><br />Hattie Travers n√©e Melody Dawson has survived hardship that would have killed a lesser woman. So it was her inner struggle that I focused on throughout this book. While I felt for Reeve Prentis‚Äôs inner turmoil about whether a man in his precarious and perilous profession should marry, it was Melody who drew my attention. She‚Äôs strong willed and determined; even her abusive husband wasn‚Äôt able to drown her courage entirely. I found myself utterly admiring of her fortitude, her willingness to do anything for her children or her father.<br /><br />Ms. Dawson is no fainting miss in need of rescue, not once she‚Äôs free of her former husband‚Äôs clutches. So it was gratifying to read about her final confrontation with him. The novel tries just a little too hard to keep our hero and heroine on the right side of the law in the case of dealing with the bad guys. However, there are passages about so-called decent people that aren‚Äôt as good as they appear and desperadoes that aren‚Äôt as bad as they seem. They keep this book from being a prissy tome about the primrose path of sin.<br /><br />For people who like stories about folks who‚Äôve walked a rough road and just want a second chance, Outlaw Hunter provides that sense of redemption that is hard won and well earned.",2.0,Books,0,7

"PSA: Nintendo manufactured more of these back in November!: Fantastic amiibo, but before I get to my &#34;review&#34;, I want to just let potential buyers know that Nintendo issued a manufacturing order for more of these back in November, and we're finally beginning to see restocks in different places. I finally bought mine yesterday from Gamestop brand new at MSRP thanks to this restock! So either find a retailer that recently got their new shipment, or wait until Amazon gets theirs. (Note: the restock at my local GS happened only yesterday, they only received 3, and I got the last one, so act fast if you find a retailer who's got them restocked) And from past experience with Nintendo restocks, Amazon will likely sell them at MSRP as well, a significant dip from the gougers' prices.<br /><br />Anyway, the amiibo set is great! I like Samus' pose here, as it mirrors the box art of Metroid: Samus Returns (so far, the only game that has unlockable content exclusive to this and the Metroid amiibo).

"Horrifying: This is the scariest movie I think I have ever seen.  It started off kinda lame, but that was part of what lulled you into watching it not expecting what was coming next.  The fact that it was based on a true story and that at the end during the credits it shows the people involved made it scarier even though the movie was over.  If you love horror/thriller type movies, this will freak you smooth out.  The blood and gore was kept to a minimum, the movie didn't need that to be horrifying.  I watched it alone and in the dark, because that's how I like to watch scary movies.  Big mistake.  LOL.  I recommend this highly, but I won't be watching it again.  That's how scary it is.  Don't let any kids see this, even though there's no nudity or much blood, it will terrify them.  Use your own judgement, but I would never let kids under about 16 see it.  I literally prayed after it was over as if I had let evil into my house.  I don't remember a movie that made me feel like that.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Case did not fit!: While this case may fit a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone, I purchased it because the sales info I was reading when considering the purchase stated that it was for a Galaxy S3. Only when it shipped, and I received the shipping information did I begin to start seeing &#34;S2&#34; references.  I thought the price was very reasonable, but the thing was so inexpensive, I didn't even contact the seller because I chalked it up to what I refer to as &#34;stupid tax&#34;, and not worth the hassle it would take to attempt a return of this thing. It's light weight and very thin, but cheap enough where one could purchase several in many different colors to change them out at will. I suppose if it fit my phone, I would most definitely offer more stars. AND, please keep in mind that my rating is based on that fact.",1.0,Unknown,0,32

I am not one who would ""willingly"" choose horror, but it was so much fun to get creeped out by Santa Claus (or whoever that creature was - shudders).

"My cats love it: I have four cats and they play in this for HOURS. I can easily fold it and store it away for company or pull it out and rearrange it into different play tunnels. I ordered three total so I can turn my whole house into a kitty tunnel place.<br /><br />I prefer this over the standard cat sized cat tubes because the tunnels are big enough for them to stand and sit in, as well as for me to crawl through for extra fun. They also seem to hold up better than the feline version, even with claws. My cats love the mesh to look out of and enjoy chasing the bonus balls. They usually chase each other through the times and argue over the best ‚Äúroom‚Äù.<br /><br />It‚Äôs so much fun watching them have fun and I‚Äôm so glad I spoiled them. It‚Äôs an excellent reward system for them for good behavior and gives them hours of pay and fun exercise. It also works well as a bonding tool for my shy cat and gets her off the windowsill to play with her sisters.<br /><br />They have other cat tunnels made for cats for the same price, but due to the size constraints one of them hogs it and the others don‚Äôt get to play, resulting in hurt feelings and the others not wanting to play. This cat tunnel eliminates those issues because it‚Äôs big enough for ask four to enjoy simultaneously even without the extra pieces.<br /><br />10/10 best cat toy ever",5.0,Toys_and_Games,1,31

"Simple and Awesome!: I bought this drip coffee maker for a backpacking trip my brother and I were taking.  I was very impressed with the quality of the maker.  The silicone cone is sturdy when open and collapses easily.  We were able to rinse it clean with a splash of hot water from the kettle.  I love that it uses standard No. 4 paper filters.

"Only negative is tight fit (if it fits at all) in many car cup holders: This is a great water bottle. It keeps the water cold for a very long time. It looks great. It's extremely durable. These colors look great. The &#34;bite and sip&#34; mouthpiece takes a little getting used to but it's a great feature because the water never spills so you can knock it over in the car and not worry about spilling a drop. You can drink even lying down in bed. Very convenient. It's a very tight, precarious fit in most standard car cup holders. It works best in the holders that are adjustable. Because it doesn't spill, I don't worry about just putting it in the seat next to me or even having it a little uncertain in the holder because if it falls out, I know it's not going to spill.",4.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

She is likable despite her faults, and I love her backstory and her journey.<br />This honestly can't be a coherent review because I just liked it so much, and the ending was great, and as soon as I finished it, I gushed to my friend who had no idea what I was saying.<br />It's a great holiday read (or not holidays honestly) because it's Christmas-y but not overly festive in my opinion. It's snarky and fun and fast, and I highly recommend it.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Irene has to do her best to contain the damage: Review first posted at &lt;a href=""http://www.girl-who-reads.com/2017/01/review-burning-page-by-genevieve-cogman.html"">Girl Who Reads.&lt;/a> A free copy of this book was provided for an honest review.<br /><br />Irene is a Librarian, a member of an organization that moves between parallel worlds to obtain rare and unique books to be kept within the safety of the Library. The Librarians are all well versed in the Language, a means of commanding others or subtly changing the world around them to achieve their goals. Irene and her apprentice Kai have gotten into trouble before, and as a result, she is on probationary status. There's trouble brewing in the Library, however, and it's a danger that can threaten not only countless worlds but the Library itself. Irene has to do her best to contain the damage, but there's uncertainty at every step.<br /><br />As a fan of the TV show &#34;The Librarians&#34; and the made for TV movies that they were spawned from, I was excited to see the summary of The Burning Page by Genevieve Cogman. I hadn't read the prior novels in this series but had no trouble getting the idea of the Library and the powers that the Librarians had. Irene refers to events from the prior novels (so I'll be spoiled for them when I go back to read them!) but there's enough of an idea about what happened that I could still continue with the current story. It's a fascinating mix of recognizable characters and subtle changes to show the differences between worlds. Vale lives at 221B Baker Street, for example, and is a detective that needs to solve complicated puzzles of cases. The magic of the Librarians, dragons, and fae described in the book is fascinating. There's so much action, and moving through the underbelly of London and the different worlds also reminded me of Neil Gaiman's &#34;Neverwhere,&#34; another favorite of mine. It's a wonderfully detailed book but isn't bogged down by those details, either. If anything, that makes it feel immersive, as if this is a movie unfolding. Irene is a plucky and likable character, and I really liked Kai. A number of other characters aren't described as well, though it could be because more time had been spent with them in the prior books. There's such a sense of history in Irene's interactions with the other characters, but not knowing that history in detail doesn't ruin the flow of the story. Instead, it adds to the air of mystery and the almost claustrophobic sense that permeates the book as Irene is trying to figure out who is trying to kill her and help destroy the Library. I heartily recommend this book, especially to bibliophiles.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Good fitting boxing gloves make a difference: Update July 31, 2014<br />30 days later and the seams are coming apart.  The hook and loop cuff that you use to secure the glove to your wrist detached itself from the elastic band.  Various seems seem to be breaking free elsewhere on the glove but none as notable as the cuff.  Highly irritating, but you get what you pay for.  These are cheaply made gloves that are perfect if you don't intend to use them heavily or often.  If that doesn't fit your expected need, keep looking because these aren't the gloves you're looking for.  Rating revised to 2/5 from 5/5.<br /><br />Original review July 1, 2014<br />The right size is everything.  I was using too small of a glove on the heavy bag and was experiencing rather irritating hand, wrist and elbow pain.  Went to the local sporting goods store and tried on some different gloves to see how they felt and found that this size felt much better on my hand.  Ordered via Amazon and noticed an immediate difference after one session on the bag.  These are great gloves at a great price and I look forward trying to wearing them out!

Brighter Holidays without climbing ladders.: I recently bought these at Walgreens.  I purchased three for the best effect. I tried 2 but realized it would look much more uniform with the extra unit.  I have the units around 30 feet from the front of my ranch.  The front of my house is about 150 feet long.  I plugged them in and they looked beautiful.  Beware one of my units out of the box was not very bright.  I just exchanged it at the store and problems solved.  I recommend these with the understanding the commercials are misleading as to the coverage one unit provides.  The further back you place the unit the wider the coverage however the intensity of the light dininishes.  So using three lights closer to the house really stands out from the street.

"Great Coverage!!!  Leg Holes Tight: Ok here‚Äôs my two cents on this.  A lot of reviews said to size up... but in the fit averages quite a few said fit as expected.. soooooo  I went a head and got my regular size, medium, since a don't have a lot of legs and I‚Äôm losing weight.  I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù about 135 lbs size 6-8, carry my weight in my belly ‚òπÔ∏è.  Well they fit, but as others mentioned the leg holes are VERY tight!!  I didn‚Äôt think this would be a problem for me cause I don‚Äôt have a lot of hips but they make this unnatural looking crease where the elastic is so tight... see photos.  After wearing them for a while they‚Äôre a tad bit uncomfortable so with both factors combined I‚Äôm gonna try a large.  Otherwise I am super impressed with them!  The fabric is very thick, makes me feel comfortable and super good coverage!!

Running out of key supplies can force your products to sit in your warehouse unable to be shipped, which can ruin your customer satisfaction and, ultimately, your bottom line.""<br /><br />This ""insight"" was chosen at random and for the full 365 papery pages it never gets any better, folks.",3.0,Books,0,7

"History for those who care.: History is for everybody-not just those who know insignificant bits of information about pieces of history but for those who look for keys to the whole picture.  Many of the reviewers of this book missed the point and therefore the importance of Durschmied's  work by presenting the panoply of historical movement.  Historians, and those historical camp followers of their exegesis, seem to take delight in excoriating writers who attempt to trespass on hallowed historical ground by presenting sacrosanct history in ways that can blosom debate and general intellectual intercourse.<br />""The Hinge Factor"" is a superb attempt to shine a torch on some of the murkier areas of European history.  How many people know how poorly the British were led during the early stages of the Boer War or the importance of the battle of Tannenberg to the  history of 20th century?  I loved this book and I feel that there should be more opportunities for readers to argue and confront history and yes, ask questions about ""what if"" through the reading of books such as this.  Questions arising from books such as his are the meat of history-of course history must be written carefully-but was &lt;Thucydides ""trained"" and his history is, arguably, one of the five greatest historical works in European history.<br />I intend reading his other titles because there is a huge need for his kind of history-history that pulls back the curtains that have clouded our vision when history is left only to the ""experts""",5.0,Books,1,7

"Phil Dick Revisited: This strong first novel follows two paths.  On the one hand our narrator has perceptions of the world that are strange and mystical.  He wonder's if Richard S. Shaver -- who wrote about evil underground dwellers callefd the &#34;dero&#34; that &#34;tampered&#34; with mankind was right.  The other thread is the storyof a young  man in the 70s coming of age and overcoming mental illness.  But neither path is the Truth.  Truth comes from synthesis -- of Wonder and the day job, of Terror and home maintence.  This book provides hope and Horror, Wonder and responsibility with a good dose of humor and a healthy disrespect for authority.  Besides it includes a diagramfor making a &#34;cootie catcher.&#34;  This is a happy, tender version of themes that Phillip k. Dick obsessed with.

I don't know what these sellers are smoking but this leash is NOT 2.5mm thick. Its 1mm(I measured it) and feels the same as the cheap leashes you can get from the dollar store. The design is super cool, the handles are comfortable and soft, and it seems well sewn together, but the main material feels cheap. It'll get the job done but feels like it wont last a long time. But that's what you get at this price range. I'd recommend this for a small dog or senior dog that doesnt chew because a hard puller would make this snap and a chewier would get through it in seconds. It's cheap, so you could maybe use it for training a puppy and expect it to get chewed to pieces while its teething, then replace it with a better quality one later on.",3.0,Unknown,0,32

Many years earlier, Lucy, immigrates from Ireland to New York as a young woman, with her sister Maeve to start a new life.<br /><br />This book is beautifully written.

I enjoy multigenerational stories, and stories of love and forgiveness and this book have all that and more.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the friendships of both generations.

Unlike some costumes I considered, it was very comfortable, and didn't have any pieces that could fall off, become untied, get lost, etc. It was quick to put on or take off and was no more cumbersome for my child than a pair of overalls. On a cooler day, a child can wear pants and a shirt underneath, or just a onesie if it is warm outside. It also looks really genuine with NASA logos, etc. I was very happy with it and my child enjoyed it. Very true to size.",5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"Beautiful & Functional Cookware: My wife and I both love to cook.  We enjoy having nice ""tools"" for our cooking.  These pans are wonderful, they feel well balanced and have a nice fit and finish.  It seems like the handles are well attached and will stay that way.  Also, the lids fit snugly on both pans.  We purchased the 1.5 qt and 3.5 qt sizes  as these give us a nice range of sizing for our needs.<br /><br />The only one negative experience was the advertising leaflet that was included with the cookware.  With the 1.5 qt pan there was a ""thank you"" leaflet indicating that because of their appreciation I would receive ""up to 15% discount"" on my next AVACRAFT product.  And with the 3.5 qt saucepan the offer was ""up to 25%"" discount on the next purchase.  DON'T BELIEVE IT!<br /><br />Even though we purchased 2 pans I received a code for a meager 10% discount code and I had to request it 3 times over a 24 hour period.  I was actually going to consider buying another pan - the 2.5 qt - when and if a 25% discount came through. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed when I saw the 10% discount code.<br /><br />Why offer 25% and then give 10%?  It only sets up the customer for disappointment.  I guess they feel it is necessary to get you to sign up on their Website.  But it left such a bad feeling it would have been better if they didn't offer anything.  10% is not enough and after this I will look at other brands.  I don't like deceptive practices.  If this is any example of their business model they are in trouble.<br /><br />However, the product is nice.  It's too bad they ruined my heretofore pleasant experience with their deception.",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Gleeful Revenge Fantasy: Mrs. Martin‚Äôs Incomparable Adventure is the latest installment in Ms. Milan's Worth Saga series.  The novella follows Mrs. Bertrice Martin, a wealthy widow who is seventy-three years old.  She has no time for politeness, no use for men, and has been at loose ends since her group of friends have all passed away recently.<br /><br />Miss Violetta Beauchamps arrives on Mrs. Martin‚Äôs doorstep looking for money.  Mrs. Martin‚Äôs Terrible Nephew has been living at Violetta‚Äôs rooming house and has not paid his rent.  Mrs. Martin cut off her Terrible Nephew years before and refuses to cover his debts.  Instead, she devises a plan to make his life miserable because it sounds like more fun than heading to Bath as her doctor has suggested.<br /><br />Mis. Milan accomplishes a lot in such a few pages.  This novella has you laughing out loud one minute and raging at the Patriarchy the next.  It is a gleeful revenge fantasy that explores issues of gender, age, social class, and power.  The tension woven throughout the story hinges on the very real possibility that the Terrible Nephew -- despite his laziness, despite his utter stupidity -- will triumph over the heroines simply because he is a white man of the upper class.  As if that were not enough, Bertrice and Violetta also fall in love and live happily ever after.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"great little waterproof camera!: As other reviews have stated, it's a great little camera, for what it's designed for, with a few minor drawbacks but they aren't enough to keep from purchasing it. We got ours about 6 weeks ago, but have used it almost daily so far this summer, in pools, waterparks, canoeing, at the stable where we ride horses, at the park....pretty much everywhere!! Our take on some of the features:<br /><br />waterproof - 100% yes, and amazing shots in/under the water.  No problems in the pool or at the waterpark, although I did notice this morning that some of the plastic coating around the keys seems to be peeling up this morning - not sure what is up with that but I'm not very happy about it...<br /><br />12MP pictures - for a point & shoot, takes excellent pictures.  Has underwater setting, sport setting, night setting etc, for even better pictures. Have not used video funtion to say how it works.<br /><br />Battery life - sucks, to be blunt.  We rarely get a full day out of the battery, a day and a half tops.  Although I do take a LOT of pictures.  Extra battery and/or car charger are an absolute necessity and need to be factored into overall cost.  One note - for some reason the camera WILL let you put the battery in UPSIDE DOWN!!!  Locks right into place too!  So if you replace the battery and it doesn't power on, try switching out the battery position.<br /><br />Physical attributes - small/compact, lightweight, huge display screen.  Battery/memory card door slot IS very hard to open, but once you figure it out it's not bad.  There is no viewfinder on the camera, if this bugs you (it does my husband) which is really only bad in situations like very bright light where you can't see the LCD very well.  Tons of settings, and very similar to other fuji cameras as well ( I have a fuji SLR with similar functions so I LOVED not having to re-learn all the settings)<br /><br />Overall, a great camera and we've really had fun using it.  For $150 an excellent buy, as long as it continues to hold up - only time will tell on that one...but plan to spend another $20 for extra battery/car charger.  We get stopped by people all the time asking about it at the waterpark & pool, and so far I have highly recommended it.  I'm a little concerned about the peeling around the key area, so I will keep an eye on that and update later.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

Best thing I ever bought.....: Best thing I ever bought for my Ford. I have a 2018 Ford F150 XLT 5.0L. I wanted to do my own oil change and found out that it will be super messy. I watched a few videos and everyone of them were messy. Someone said twist the yellow plastic drain plug (which I will never understand why plastic) and slowly twist it til the oil slowly comes through. Then hold it for 2 minutes. Doesn't work. I suggest hold it longer than 2 minutes. Like 5 minutes. I know to long but will be less of a mess. Anyway. Bought the Ronin because I've seen videos and many people recommend it. The price is high but it does exactly what it is designed to do and the name is pretty awesome (Ronin). The material is made of billet and you can never go wrong with that. It is only made for Fords that have the dreaded yellow drain plug. I recommend it to anyone that does not what to continue to have a mess. Buy it.

I always make sure to keep an eye on him, due to the other reviewers warnings about caught up claws, but haven't had a problem at all.

"Very important for a healthy pet!: This is a WONDERFUL product. Pets are generally are fed processed food (dry or wet) which no longer has ANY live natural bacteria or enzymes. Live enzymes and probiotics are essential to the health of the digestive system and assimilating nutrients. This is true for humans as well. A daily dose, is easy to add to food, takes a small amount so it is very cost effective. Pay a little now and skip the vet bills now and future illnesses.<br /><br />Quick story: In April 2009 my 13 year old Queensland Heeler was showing signs of giving up.. skin and hair problems, anxiety, weight loss and some pain with walking and play.  I was planning on putting her down before the 4th of July to avoid the stress from all the fireworks.  I started giving her a scoop of product with her meals, by July 4 she was happy, running, smooth fir and skin, She lived happily for another year and a half... playing with our other dog again like a puppy... No bad breath, clear eyes, easy yard clean up.. All wonderful results. When it was time for her to leave our world she was beautiful, calm and ready.<br />. My new pup, a Rat Terrier, was a rescue with runny eyes and rough red skin,, now bright eyed, happy with soft smooth skin and fur.  Can not recommend the product more...<br />UPDATE: When I ran out of the product and did not feed it to Bella, my Rat Terrier, for 3 months her runny eye problem returned.

"An Admirable Life: The media portrayed Mark Fidrych as some sort of cartoonish amalgam of Forrest Gump and Napoleon Dynamite. The underlying value of this biography is its' ability to properly place Fidrych's meteoric baseball career within the framework of his successful life outside the diamond. His youthful baseball exploits and early fame enhanced but did not define the remainder of his too brief life.<br />  As a medical doctor, the author recognizes Mark's lifelong struggle with ADHD. His ability to function within the limitation of this condition and to not succumb to the lures of early celebrity status should be admired. The true generosity and openness of his character is obvious in this well researched and documented book making it a worthy addition to the library of both the baseball aficionado and the general reader.",5.0,Books,1,7

"I don't know how they do it....: I'm always nervous when Artists I like come out with new albums because there's always the chance I don't like the songs. However, BTS seems to impress me more and more with each album they come out with. They have catchy music that takes bits and pieces from other styles and puts them together in a gloriously BTS-like fashion. Their lyrics are always meaningful, because they speak to the fans, expressing their own thoughts and emotions, while sometimes speaking directly to their audience. The fact that they produce a lot of their own music makes it all the more impressive. I am incredibly impressed by this album in particular because they have tried new styles and have pushed themselves even more than their last (Which I also loved). I admire the fact that they are always pushing themselves to try something different, and what surprises me is they always pull it off and make it amazing.

"Loved......: This was the story I really wanted & waited for & I was not disappointed. We were teased mightily by what was going on behind the scenes with these 2 in the last book, but never told & this fills in all the blanks. Thank you!<br /><br />I loved both leads.

"Uninspired: Ana Gabriel, the radiant Mexican anomaly. She has never been one to steer wrong on the musical path, but on her latest release, her spark seems to have faded temporarily.<br /><br />  Titled ""Tradicional:, Ana Gabriel offers standard and factory-made Mariachi beats to mostly non-original songs. Her vocals are so unlike her, that one has to wonder WHY she bothered recording this album. She only wrote one of the tracks, which makes me think that she is saving her good material for a new label? Who knows, not me. I surely hope so, Ana Gabriel is one of the few artists today that still offers music to think to and drink to at times. Her talent is limitless and she is destined for legendary status. I can honestly say that there are no standout tracks. Much like her previous album, the music isn't half as exciting as the album cover, which in this case is quite exotic. The color scheme covering the backgroud of a Mountain setting sitts well with the font of the title. This is sad to realize that talking about the cover brings more out of me than describing the tripe that is this music.<br /><br />  We all know that Ana Gabriel is capable of a great, mind-shattering performance, even in the ranchera field, so I will not conclude to any reasoning as to why this album was made. I will just sit patiently to hear from Ana with a GOOD album for once.",3.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,0,8

"Amazon wouldn't let me cancel this READ BEFORE YOU BUY: I didn't really want this product, Amazon however would not allow me to cancel it despite two weeks notice and multiple requests. But I will still give this a fair review:<br /><br />The audio quality is great for gaming as it is balanced, not so great for music as a result, but it's a gaming headset. In comparison to the 7.1 surround sound headset they replaced, I am still able to audio locate possible threats almost as good.<br /><br />The wireless range is a strong 10m/30ft. I can stay on voice chat and walk to the bathroom or fridge no problem. The battery life is great, i probably only charge it once a week.<br /><br />The downsides MUST READ BEFORE BUYING<br />There is a voice over that is LOUD and overbearing. When you press the mute button it loudly broadcasts into your ear MICROPHONE OFF. Then you unmute and it screams MICROPHONE ON loud enough for everyone in discord to hear.<br />When you turn on the headset is screams POWER ON.... CONNECTED. It's just excessive auditive cues that make me hate this headset. And the worst part? You can't use the headset while it's charging! The second you plug it in it screams in your ears POWER OFF. There's no indication of battery life outside of when it screams into your ear at max volume BATTERY LOW. It will give you about 2-3 loud screams spaced out by about 5 minutes before it finally dies.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />The clamping force is adequate, as is the cushioning, but there are no joints with which it can adjust to your head.

"Didn't Want Series to End: I bought this book when it was on sale because I fell in love with the cover. Then I bought the first two because I can't read a series out of order. Unfortunately, this series was written or published out of order. Read Spy's Honor first. It happens 4-5 years before Assassin's Gambit.<br /><br />A lot of times when I read a series, I find the later books start getting repetitive and formulaic. Not so with this series. At least, not so far. I love how each book carries the continuity of the world building but has its own flavor. Spy's Honor introduced familiars, sea and shroud mages, and spies while this book focused on fire mages, volcanoes, and assassination attempts.<br /><br />This story is about Celeste, who has serious confidence issues thanks to her marriage to the villain in Assassin's Gambit. She made a very sympathetic character that I immediately connected with. I also liked the hero, Prince Rayn, and I like how Lucien was portrayed with a sense of humor in this one.<br /><br />Of the first three, this book was the most poetic. Oh, it didn't have actual poetry in it, but some of the descriptions, especially of the fire and fire spirits, were poetic. Raby really has a way with words. I found myself highlighting passages simply for the beauty of them.<br /><br />I've gotten so attached to these characters and this world, I'm sorry to be nearing the end of the series.

"Nice gloves...Note that they run small.: These are nice gloves. Materials seem to be quality. They seem well assembled. Warm enough for cool mornings and evenings. I'm comfortable in them down to about 40 deg. (I do have heated grips and large handguards.) They're fine in all but the worst heat. So far in the 80's is fine. 90's and hotter I'll probably switch to a lighter MX style glove.<br />The only complaint is that they run small. I do not have large hands, and wear a medium in most gloves. The size chart recommended a med. for me.  They fit ok, but the thumb was so short that it was uncomfortable. I returned them for a large. I was worried that they would be loose and sloppy but the large fits perfect. Order a size up and you'll be stoked.",5.0,Automotive,1,4

"The blunt sword that is sharpening: What Trifkovic writes is in full accordance with my own experiences with Islam students and imams in Pakistan and Iran. It is of course not so with the majority of the people living there who would reject a basic hostility towards non-muslim people. It seems that it is a great boon to mankind that most muslims are no scriptural-orthodox Islam followers whereas it is a great tragedy that most Christians do not keep to their holy scriptures. The author does not condemn the muslims, but he is critical to a belief that helped Islam to spread in the past only by the power of the sword and could do so in the future if the West does not want to realize the threat that the Islam incorporates.<br />My observation in islam countries is that the broad public is misinformed about the West, Christian belief and its own religion being steadily influenced by the clerics and fundamentalists who use all means of propaganda. Since most people there are uneducated and the media are under control they have no access to world information and are prone to all sort of enticements.<br />One aspect the author also exemplifies is that there is no peace among muslims themselves! The hate towards Israel holds them together. This is sth the muslim clerics also understand. If there was no Israel we had yet war among the muslim statesin the Middle East.<br />Trifkovic titled his work ""Sword"" because it is the major instrument of Islam and also of Islam`s ""peace"". What in the American wild west was called peacemaker (a shotgun) is in Islam also a deadly weapon. It is well known how Muhammad used this instrument. This can be read in the Quran. His biography has a trail of blood, not blood of self-defence but of assassinations, mass-murder, executions and attacks. The question of Trifkovic is whether Islam has changed? Is there a reason why Islam should change? The world is still not set free of un-believers.<br />The successors of Muhammad went on with the ""peace""- tactics. In obedience to AllaH`s command to behead apostates, Muhammads successor and father-in-law, Abu Bakr, and loyal Muslim warriors killed seventy thousand former Muslims, because they had decided to stop to follow this blood-dancing. So arabs killed arabs, former muslims killed by muslims. This was called in history the ""Wars of the Apostasy"".<br />But there were also the wars to legalize the follower of Muhammad and find the true leader. Muhammad`s closest companions and staunchest disciples (some of whom he had praised to be perfect followers) fought each other for wealth and power. That was peaceful Islam among muslims. In the Iran - Irak war and now the Shiites and Sunni parties in Irak prove how Islam is peace even within its own borders. In Afghanistan rival Muslim warlords still fight another. In Pakistan muslims of one party assassinate muslims of the other party. And like in Irak infidels from the West have to intervene to stop fighting and bring some civilized order into that chaos of ""peaceful"" Islam. This only deserves to be mentioned, because Islam claims I deed peace within its own house. But I said already that muslims mostly are no real muslims. On the contrary to the treatment of the fidels, infidels can be killed to conquest their lands and possessions for the Islam. And that is what they did industriously.<br />In 712 muslim raiders under Muhammad Qasun began the invasion of India, demolishing temples and palaces and massacring entire cities. As in Constantinople, where the streets would one day run with blood, the slaughter went on for three days in India`s port city of Debal. Trifkovic writes: ""the massacres perpetrated by Muslims in India are unparalleled in history, bigger in sheer numbers than the Holocaust""<br />The Abbasid dynasty ruled until 1258 and under them the Islamic empire reached its zenith of power, prosperity and learning. The slaughtering went on during the conquest of Spain. Violence is inevitably the fruit of Islam in its complete history. Is there any example that can be given where Islam ever brought peace anywhere to any people? It could be questioned. There was also slaughter of Christians in the whole Middle East. In the process of the conquest, the Christians of Damascus were killed or sold into slavery, their churches burned down. The same procedure almost everywhere. According to Runciman in ""The history of the Crusades"" The Sultan Baibar had all the population decapitated when they surrendered.<br />In 1400 another typical leader devoted to Islam swept from east to west leaving behind a trail of blood. Timur or Tamerlane devasted countries and towns. He ordered executions in the tenthousands, mostly Christians. At Sivas 4000 were buried alive. ""Historians estimate the number of dead at Sary to be 100.000, at Bagdad 90.000, at Isfahan 70.000."" If this is true, most of the victims must have been muslims because these countries were already muslim.<br />Islam excelled even the Catholic church (which is said to be a ""Christian"" church) in the number of atrocities. These are only examples of a long list of the successful spreading of Islam peace all over the world.<br />How was Islam stopped? In Europe it was Karl Martell in the west and the Austrians with strong support of the Polnish inthe east of Europe who stopped the Islam with the very sword Islam had drawn. How could Islam be stopped today? It is widely suggested with appeasement politic. Any possible threats are swept under the carpet of political and religious indulgence! If the arabs had no oil, who would care for ""tolerance"" of religions in the west? If the West would not be militarily strong, which arab would care peace talk, which is now necessary to survive?<br />Is there a wilful blindness on the part of the west and the determination not to face the truth about Islam climbs to ever higher levels of naivete? So much that extreme Muslims need not hide their vicious agenda. The Hamas website boldly proclaims to a world that refuses to believe that the horror can be real: ""We are a nation that drinks blood, and ... there is no blood better than the blood of the Jews.""<br />Now this is irrational! Yes, that is also what the victims of muslim swords thought before their throats were cut. Instead the West continues to blame Israel (she has no oil!), for not making ""peace"" with such enemies. It is very strange what happens out there. Even the 11/9 event could not awaken the dreamers.<br />This book can be recommended., I think even the Hamas could distribute it. It must be recognized that it might be not too late to save the majority of muslims from the propaganda of the extremists.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Corel Graphics Suite x7 is buggy.: Long time user of corel products. Last was CGS12, which transferred to Win7 pro with occasional instability problem that spoiled work. I should have been happy with that little bit of trouble.<br />But, bought CGSx7. There were default set up problems from the start. No matter how CGSx7 Photo-Paint was entered as default for jpegs, they opened only with Windows Photo Viewer. After multiple emails to and adjustments suggested by Corel techs, no solution.<br />As usual, Microsoft techs dumped problem on me, saying corrupted files left over from pre-install of Win 7 Pro. Checked all that before install. None there. Also said possible virus. Deep scan said that not happening.<br />Almost every online forum discussed same problem, again no solution.<br />However, online comments also noted no problem with CGSx6, especially for CGSx7 users who had problems and reverted to that earlier version. That indicates to me that Corel made at least one change between CGSx6 and x7 and this problem is the result. Getting them to produce a fix or even suggest they might have caused the problem goes against the software industries' deeply ingrained philosophy - &#34;our product is faultless. Any problems come from the user.&#34;<br />And, of course, that is not the only problem with the app, but it is the deal breaker.<br />So, its back to CGS12 for me and good luck to any Win 7 pro user who goes for CGSx7.",2.0,Software,0,27

"My Bluedio Victory better be fake because if they're real there's a lot of snake oil surrounding their reviews.: Although the company said they would help me, they actually didn't.  But I didn't have original purchase papers and proof because I bought used on eBay.  I asked them just to verify if what I bought were actually real ones and that was the end of communication when I sad I bought used.  I guess the warranty is non-transferable and no help if you lose any information that you are supposed to obtain when you purchase?  I sent the auction # but no help.  Headphones are awful, the Vinyl Plus are good, though.<br /><br />Does anybody know if there are fake ones of these circulating?  I bought mine from empsky on eBay &#34;used&#34; for $87 and they sound like the worst headphone garbage I ever heard.  Far worse than the company's own $35-$40 F800 which isn't too bad or too good and way worse than the Vinyl or Vinyl Plus, which both I like. But I hate the companies TE in-ear, they refuse to stay in the ear and simply make me mad even trying to use them.<br /><br />  Here is what I was told by empsky from eBay when I asked are these fakes: &#34;I have purchased those pair on Mar. 28 2017 from AliExpress shipped from United States (Bluedio Yang). I am sorry to hear that the sound is not what you have expected, it was my first try with this brand and I am not familiar with their other cans.&#34;<br /><br />  If these are the real deal, they suck beyond belief on every kind of music.  Floss Carter and others on YouTube who give praise to these are lying if these are the real Bluedio Victory.  I don't hate many things but I hate the sound of these and so would anybody else with decent hearing.<br /><br />  This junk has a sound signature that is so unmusical and imbalanced, they belong in the trash.  They sound worse than $15 Sony or $2 JLabs in-ear I purchased, they are WORST sound I ever heard.  Sound out of phase and like the tweeters don't work. So scratchy the sound, the bass is inaccurate and boomy, bloated, standing bass waves, the high bass hurts the ears, the high-end is nearly non-existent but what does exist is grainy and unclear: I don't want to hear the sound it makes anyway:  the midrange is imbalanced with peaks and dips.  Which part is worst?  The whole thing, even the chassis squeaks like a 30 year old car suspension.  It's heavy, ugly, sounds like a screaming baby and feels clunky and junky.  Can't believe they sell for $180 and have 4.4 stars if mine are real, no way possibly.<br /><br />  I recommend any other headphone I own:  Sennheiser Momentum 2 on-ear, Audio Technica ATH-M50X, Bluedio Victory, Victory Plus, Status OB-1 open back.  I recommend in that order except the Sennheiser I would get around ear because the on-ear hurts shortly after you start wearing and the Victory over the Victory Plus only because the sound difference isn't worth the price difference.<br /><br />Good luck, wanted to save anyone from buying these junk from AliExpress, at least.

"beware of ArcSoft products: CAUTION, be forewarned by my experiences:  the three ArcSoft products I own have all been exercises in frustration, wasted time and effort, and failure to function.<br /><br />ArcSoft sells BUGGY software.  For example, PhotoBase 4.5 & Photo Impression 5 both fail to install on an HP PC running Windows XP Home Edition.  Panorama Maker 3 installs and opens but gives error messages when trying to work with albums and files.<br /><br />ArcSoft DOES NOT SUPPORT their products.  They do not answer emails or phone calls.  Their internet knowledge base is very spotty and incomplete.  When downloads are available, ArcSoft instructs customers to have no confidence in them:  ""Program patches/updates ... may or may not work, and may actually cause your program(s) to function improperly.""<br /><br />ArcSoft intentionally designs their software to be USER-UNFRIENDLY.  For example, there is no help feature and no display of version number in Panorama Maker 3.  If users go online to the ArcSoft knowledge base and search, they will find a listing of 5 steps to go through to discover a version number.  The manual and knowledge base have no index and no list of errors or ways to troubleshoot them.",1.0,Software,0,27

Marigold and Tristan's story came across as so unique and absolutely so fun to watch unfold. I loved all the scenes and the ways the author threw them together and watching how their perspectives of each other changed as they faced different circumstances together. The author wove this story so wonderfully- I enjoyed learning more about the archery scene- the terms and game itself- as well as having these lovely secondary characters that I hope we get to know more in the future!

The landscapes are too tiny without zoom, I like to get in close and look at the art or find secrets, it's what I like to do with these kinds of games but without zoom I can only mash all over the screen in hope find something because I can't make out the detail.  Music is on a short loop and not very good but by far the worse aspect is the atrocious and wooden acting, really laughable at times.  Another downside is I have toggled off any help for secrets and it still insists to let me know via an obtrusive pull out tip on the side.  The ho are somewhat clunky with hotspots getting in the of actions sometimes, they do mix up styles with different tricks instead of straight find object which I like.<br /><br />Two stars for artwork.

"Great writing: Great writing happens when a book is capable of evoking strong emotions, even if they are quiet, strong emotions. Kristina McMorris has proven her genius in creating an interesting story about troubled people and times which packs a powerful punch.<br /><br />As McMorris states in the Author‚Äôs Notes, the premise of the book begs a question; ‚ÄúSpecifically, what if a reporter‚Äôs seemingly harmless choice to stage a photo led to unintended consequences for everyone involved?‚Äù But is staging a photo or stretching the truth ever an excuse for honesty? The characters in ‚ÄúSold On A Monday‚Äù have to grapple with these issues and come to terms with faulty judgments, decisions and actions.<br /><br />The story starts in August, 1931, in a small town in Pennsylvania. It was a time when men wore starched collars, suits and fedoras, women wore skirts and dresses and always gloves. The effects of the Market crash of 1929 were still being felt. It was a hard time for so many, the breadlines were long, people were always hungry, not many jobs to be had. Newspapers ruled the world of communication.<br /><br />I loved the characters. Ellis Reed who can‚Äôt stop stumbling as he strives for the newspaper career he has always wanted. Lillian Palmer, bright, strong, secretary to the Editor of the Philadelphia Examiner, holds her secrets close. Both of their families are integral to the story and the importance of family strife and support is subtlety evident throughout. The parts attributed to Geraldine Dillard and her children Ruby and Calvin may just rip out your heart with sorrow and anger. This story has so many moving parts but they all coalesce to make a well constructed story. Heart wrenching and uplifting.  I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Thank you NetGalley and Sourcebooks for a copy",5.0,Books,1,7

"unusable: This is NOT a gift card as it says in the title. This deposits ""virtual credits"" into some virtual bank that is associated but nearly unfindable in your ""account."" I purchased this specifically as a gift for my niece. I never received a code or any sort of link to redeem the credit until after I asked for a refund, which they absolutely refuse to give, even if the credit remains unused. Since I was at a birthday party, and 3 different, intelligent adults tried to figure out how to access this credit both through my amazon account and the email associated with my amazon account. We could NOT figure out how to do that. So that my niece could use her credit on her birthday, I went directly to the Roblox website and purchased a card that was immediately emailed to us. I requested a refund for this unusable item and was told it's against amazon policy to refund a digital item, even if it hasn't been accessed or used.

"Installs in a few minutes and squirrels aren't even coming around anymore.: Squirrels aren't even coming around anymore.  I was somewhat skeptical because my feeders are on a shepherd's hook and they are both about 14 to 16 inches long which meant I am not able to put the feeders a foot above the baffle as recommended.  The bottom of the baffle is about 4 feet off the ground, and the bottom of the lowest feeder is about 3 to 4 inches higher than the bottom of the baffle.  The first day after I installed it, (which took about 10 minutes at the most) I didn't see any squirrels.  The next day I actually saw a squirrel attempt to get at the feeders by climbing up the shepherd's hook until its head was hidden under the baffle, then it tried to reach out to grab the edge of the baffle and since the baffle wobbles, the squirrel was not able to get a grip on the baffle and it either fell off, or just gave up and jumped off.  A couple times after that I saw a squirrel (probably the same one) at the base of the shepherd's hook looking up and I thought maybe it might make a another attempt, but it didn't.  It's been three days now and I haven't even see a squirrel around it today.  I think maybe they have given up and decided there are easier ways to get food.<br />I have a big Oak tree  in the front yard that produces millions of acorns, which should be plenty for the squirrels.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

They do not go up all the way to my belly button and I wish that they were more high rise for my pooch. But really any shirt hides that for me. These pants fit and feel very nice.

"Works for cargo boxes but a little finicky to use.: Pros:<br />Inexpensive<br />Simple and lightweight<br />Can be mounted almost anywhere<br /><br />Cons:<br />Plastic pulleys and thin metals feel a little flimsy<br />Rope was frayed in a couple of spots<br />You may need to buy extra hardware for installation<br /><br />I used this to lift and store my Yakima Skybox 16. After over an hour trying to install this in the space above my garage door and the ceiling (when the door is open), I realized I didn't have enough clearance. The hardware adds another 8‚Äù to the height of your item as mentioned by another reviewer. My ceiling joists run perpendicular to the direction of how I intended to store the cargo box so I had to use a piece of 2x4‚Äù to place the individual pulleys exactly where I need them to be.<br /><br />I also read how the straps can crush the edge of the cargo box and I've seen several solutions but I made my own. I ran the straps through 1‚Äù PVC pipes to keep it from putting pressure on the lip of my cargo box. It works! In the near future I will be adding something to the exterior of the PVC pipe where the bottom of the box rests. Currently, it‚Äôs a little slippery and the back of the cargo box almost slipped off as I accidentally lowered the pulleys unevenly. But, as long as you raise and lower both ends together, it should be okay. I have run the pipes through the clamps of the box for more security, but I prefer being able to quickly slide the pipes away towards the front and back to free the box. So for the time being, they are located just behind each clamp.<br /><br />Also, another reviewer mentioned this was designed for kayaks and other similarly narrow items to be hoisted up onto the ceiling. They are correct. Pulling the rope straight down to disengage the gravity lock is considerably harder when you can't pull straight down because the object you are hoisting is in the way! After you finagle it a few times you'll get the hang of it, but it's still finnicky to use. For the price though, what other options do you have?",4.0,Automotive,1,4

"Best purchase of 2019: This machine is AMAZING! I got one, and loved it so much my mother got one as well. You like a good Americano or good espresso? I had a jura for about 10 years till it started going on the fritz. This pulls just as well. You want a more 'fun' coffee like a latte or cappuccino? This does it so quick and easy you just need to push a button. With my Jura, I found I was so busy I never really had time to make more fun coffees, but also the clean up was a lot so I never wanted to deal with it. The way you can easily clean the milk cannisters makes this thing a dream.<br /><br />Now, the work around for just quick frothed milk say for a hot cocoa.... I think if they're smart they'll just make this a button on future models. But to make hot cocoa, you hold the strength button for 5 seconds until the ground coffee light comes on. Hit latte or cappuccino, then after the milk is done hit the stop button. It won't waste any beans, and easily makes perfect cup of hot cocoa.<br /><br />What makes this perfect for me is this has the clean up ease/ maintenance of basically a Keurig, but you get as good if not better pull of coffee than from a high  end coffee shop. Highly recommend, best purchase of 2019 for me.",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"The Breathtaking, 80-year Journey of Baroness Jenny Tonge: From the first paragraph, ""I was a war baby, conceived in the Blitz and born as bombs rained down on the industrial Midlands early in 1941."" to the last, ""I want to remind them all, constantly, that women want opportunities, not to compete with men but to work equally alongside them, this memoir is a detailed journey of a remarkable woman.<br /><br />She was born at the cusp of women‚Äôs empowerment and reading how she blossomed from a somewhat shy young woman to become Baroness Jenny Tonge in the House of Lords, the UK is astonishing, riveting, and great fun to read. She tells her story with the understated grace that so many of us Americans admire, one of only ten women in her medical school where she concentrated on women‚Äôs health issues, something she continued to do for the rest of her life.<br /><br />It‚Äôs fascinating to read her stories traveling the world from Sierra Leone to Columbia, Rwanda to Palestine, and Uganda to Warsaw as the UK spokeswoman for International Development. Sometimes you‚Äôll laugh out loud at her stories, such as getting caught in quicksand and losing a boot to walking around in the dark looking for a loo. Every story, however, has a connection to the women in the country that she visits, and Ms. Tonge‚Äôs experiences become every woman‚Äôs experience as we read her travels.<br /><br />The last section of the book is about her work with women around the world and how much still needs to be done. She also became an outspoken advocate for justice in Palestine, an opponent of the Bush/Blair war in Iraq, and she paid the price for her honesty. I couldn‚Äôt put the book down, spent all weekend reading about this remarkable woman.

I didn't like Hadley at all -I get that she's only 18 and immature, but I really did not find any redeeming qualities.  I could not understand what Wrigley would've seen in her and been attracted to -she kept to herself and basically judged everyone around her for years following a series of elementary school bullying episodes.  Also needed a better proof read -used &#34;IUD&#34; in a sentance that was obviously meant to be &#34;IED&#34; -that was a biggy that obviously stuck with me.

"A heart-wrenching story of alcoholism's toxic effect on family.: While reading ""Please, God, Not Two"" I couldn't help but develop a true connection to the author's daughter, Lori. I found myself wishing I could reach out to her and help fight the affliction of her alcoholism. Her entire family and circle of friends suffered terribly because of this disease. The author's story brings you close to the emotions and sense of helplessness that accompanies a situation where only the afflicted has control over the outcome. But that doesn't mitigate the feelings of regret and self-doubt that a parent will assuredly feel. Loved ones will be left with the question, ""What could I have done differently to save the life that was needlessly wasted?"" People who drink and feel the slow progression of this disease, must be given this book. Maybe if they see how their drinking will destroy not only their own life, but the lives of those who love them, they may just find the strength to alter the destructive path they are on. My heart goes out to the author, Alberta Sequeira, her husband Al, and her entire family. Alberta somehow found the will to not only go on, but to try and prevent others from having to experience the same nightmare. As painful as it must have been, I salute her for sharing her story.<br />Tom Cirignano, author of ""The Constant Outsider, Memoirs of a South Boston Mechanic"" and ""67 Cents: Creation of a Killer"".",5.0,Books,1,7

"An extraordinary FPS.: I'm just going to stick to some things about the PS4 Pro version of BF1 for the most part.<br /><br />This is an exemplary FPS. The campaign is short and sweet and the graphics are truly amazing on PS4 Pro. No FPS has looked better than this with the scale of things going on here. BF1 does just about everything right. The guns, the environments, the gameplay. I love it. And this is my first main BF game.<br /><br />As far as multiplayer there are a whole host of things that get improved on PS4 Pro, but the main thing is the framerate and resolution. Both get decent bumps. 60Hz / 60FPS TDM matches are a blast. Yeah, my main mode is TDM still lol. And in this game TDM is better than it ever has been. The maps are for the most fantastic, the gunplay is easily the smoothest it has ever been on console. This is literally the only version where a console has ever come close to imitating the PC version on Ultra. It's not quite there but it is close.<br /><br />You get 30Hz matches for the bigger game modes, and some of the large maps are a tad tedious, but all in all there are tons of mods to suit your fancy, 4 classes to upgrade, and a lot of weapons to play with that are modeled exquisitely and accurately to the time period.<br /><br />The devs do patch a lot of things, and fans do have certain problems with how the game plays. Balance could be better for teams. I do hope they still address a few of these things going forward, but for the most part this is a very well done game and the future looks bright. I could not have asked for a better presentation going back to one of my favorite periods of time. Marvelous. Highly recommended.",5.0,Video_Games,1,33

"7 box's of Dynamat in one pathfinder, no carpet, five gallons of Herculiner!: [[ASIN:B0002TDUW4 Herculiner - HCL1B8 - Brush-on Bed Liner Kit]]  After deciding  I would like to fix up and keep a 91 pathfinder around for a few years. I decided I was going to take out the 20 year old carpet. I was originally only going to use Herculiner, do it yourself bedliner (I choose Herculiner because of so many positive reviews). After many days prep; I removed all the factory sound proofing tar with a hammer and chisel, then sanded with a drill and wire brush untill all was clean metal. I applied two coats of Herculiner. It looked great and was solid. I decided I wanted a slightly thicker floor. So I purchased two bulk packs of Dynamat and laid a layer. It went on so easy and looked so nice I decided I should do two layers. I bought another two bulk packs of Dynamat and laid my second layer down. I then applied a final two coats of Herculiner. It looked great. I decided to go the extra mile and do a coat of optional Herculiner UV protection. I used a quart and a half. It was going on a purple gray and I assumed it would dry black and be unnoticeable. It did not. It looked horrible. It had not changed to black and had separated in areas and bubbled as well. I called Herculiner and told them my results. They were great, they said it sounded like I had got two from a bad batch that had gotten out. They offered right away to mail me some replacement bottles. They thought I should be OK if I sanded down the bad UV protection and reapplied a coat or two of Herculiner. So I picked up another Herculiner kit from AutoZone and went to work that day. I sanded for about five minutes and realized that the UV protection was not going to just sand off. So I spent about two hours sanding all the surfice with 80grit and cleaning up the sand it produced. I then applied another two coats of Herculiner. It looked real sad. I called Herculiner again and this time I sent them some pictures of how the bad UV protection turned out after sanding and two more coats of Herculiner. If I had no other options I might of been able to sand all the UV protection off. It would have took about 40 hours, I think though. I decided the only way I would have results I'm happy with was to apply another layer of Dynamat and then two more coats of Herculiner. So I ordered two more box's of Dynamat and applied one more layer. I then applied my last two coats of Herculiner. And it looks great again. I now know why Dynamat and Herculiner are the brands brought up the most online (forums). These products worked great together and are of the highest quality. Hercliner is sending me out some replacement UV protection  that is not from a bad batch,( it should be a solid black, not purple). I will wait a year and if any of the floor fades apply some then.",5.0,Automotive,1,4

"Do Not Buy This Product (Mattress Defect): (I purchased this exact couch from Amazon in Black)<br />Ever since I purchased this Mattress, I've needed to replace the mattresses every 5 months or so... I've tried many different things to keep the mattresses from breaking down, cardboard under the mattresses, wood under the mattresses. My last attempt (best results so far), was layers of thick mattress toppers. It is painfully obvious that the mattress has a defect.<br /><br />Up until now the representatives at Handy Living had been nice about it and quick to send a replacement, so I avoided reviewing the product, because did not have anything nice to say, and thought it would be kinder to not say anything at all.<br /><br />However, now they will not even honor their mattress warranty of 5 years stated on the website. They claim that this mattress does not count as a normal mattress, so the warranty was only for a year. What's worse is that they attempted to charge me for 2 mattresses, because the design for this product required them to split the mattress in half.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the mattress defect, I would say this is a decent product, but the mattress problem is a huge red flag, and because of the design I can't just buy a mattress from somewhere else.",1.0,Unknown,0,32

I haven‚Äôt dropped the phone yet to determine how well it will stand up.overall, I am expecting it will satisfy.",5.0,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,1,9

If you are a Big guy dont even try: The xxl was too small for me. Im 6ft about 240. I wear size 40 to 42 jeans. These were too tight in the waist and the straps let out all the way were still too short for me. I will be returning both pair I ordered as soon as I figure out how. Amazon is not giving me the normal retun options for them.,1.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0,10

"Una aut√©ntica perla pop: pura belleza sin pretensiones: Take a picture es uno de esos discos, como el ""Would you believe?"" de Billy Nicholls, que ha llegado a ser valorado con el tiempo por la cr√≠tica como una verdadera obra maestra y a convertirse en aut√©ntico objeto de coleccionismo. Una artista oscura en su momento, Margo Guryan es considerada en la actualidad como una respetada compositora y una de las m√°ximas representantes, junto con Jackie DeShannon, Marianne Faithful y Claudine Longet, de esa ef√≠mera incursi√≥n del pop de finales de los 60 por los vericuetos de la sofisticaci√≥n m√°s et√©rea o, como lo llaman los japoneses (quienes lo han convertido en algo as√≠ como su pasatiempo nacional) el ""cute pop"". Como he le√≠do de alguna de esas pedantes luminarias de la historia del rock ""This album may be too good to be true, but it's also everything we could wish for"". Ah√≠ queda eso.",4.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

False desc. And photo: The desc. says it has the rings for the securing carabiners also it shows that in the photo.  I had to return the first one thinking it was just missing because the box was opened.  I paid extra for next day for this one and its the same...rip off<br />It should be pulled off the website,1.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,0,28

"Large capsules - but easy to swallow: I have been eager to give coconut oil, in a capsule form, a try. It is an easy way to make it a part of my daily routine. When I was able to give it a try, at a reduced purchase price, I wanted to take the opportunity to  give an honest and fair review of this product.<br /><br />The capsules are large, see photo below. I took one look at them and thought I would never be able to swallow that huge capsule, I typically don't do well with large tablets or capsules. However, this ended up being a breeze to swallow, no problem at all. There is no after taste.<br /><br />So, easy to swallow, an affordable per capsule price, good quality ingredients - any concerns? Just one: is one or two capsules of coconut oil enough to be a benefit. I researched using capsules,  over eating the oil by a spoonful - and several sources stated that in order to get the amount needed to be beneficial, one would have to take 48 (1000mg) capsules per day. Of course that would be expensive and hard to do.<br /><br />As I see it, having the capsules serves a purpose when being a way from home, at least I can take a small amount of oil in that way.  I am taking one capsule a day now, and will add a second capsule soon. I am eager to see if there are any noticeable benefits with this amount of coconut, taken daily.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that I will take these capsules as directed, no more or less than directed on the bottle. I know that too much coconut oil gives me stomach cramps, I can comfortably handle the mgs in the dosage of this brand. I am certain to see benefits, even if subtle. If one is wanting to take their coconut oil in capsule form, I can recommend this brand. It delivers what it claims.",4.0,Unknown,1,32
