"Seem well made, comfortable, and nice fit: I ordered these not knowing how I was going to use them. I normally wear briefs underwear, but have considered wearing boyshorts underwear. Now after having them and trying them on, I've decided to use them as shorts in the summer. I normally wear long tunic shirts and I feel like these will look great with them. Technically they will work as shorts or underwear. I like the black color, how there are no loose strings, the Molasus logo on them, how long they are, the waistband, and how well they fit. They really are quite comfortable to wear. It feels like having nothing on. I'm a larger girl and it was nice to find something that fit well, covered everything, and wasn't uncomfortable.",5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10
Just what I was looking for: Easy up and down. Light weight. Fits in a bag about 24&#34; in diam. Easy to carry. Plenty of room for 4 chairs and a small snack size table. We have a weekend retreat and in the spring the flies drive you crazy biting. I wanted something I could set up and take down alone without the help of my husband.

I will never travel without the Pack-It Cubes again!: The Eagle Creek Pack-It cubes are well worth the money.  We used these during a recent multi-week trip to Europe and they were great.  We switched hotels every couple of days and they made unpacking and repacking a cinch.  The time saved on re-packing our bags alone make these a no brainer.  It was truly delightful to have my pack as organized and compact on the last day of a month-long trip as on the first day.<br /><br />We bought a variety of sizes and that turned out to be an excellent idea.  As we used clothes we were able to consolidate cubes as necessary.  We stored our dirty clothes in the Eagle Creek compression sacs.<br /><br />I will never travel again without Pack-It Cubes.,5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

Suspenseful with a nicely constructed climax: This is the best book yet by this author. The plot was well crafted with an unanticipated ending.

"Good ideas to live by...but you have to be strong!: As a reader of Atlas Shrugged and a fan of the particular ideology that it espouses for the most part, this companion book speaks to the base truths of AS. For the most part, it is about being true to yourself and achieving based on what you want....not what others want for you. The emphasis on doing for you is important... but I think that Ayn Rand and this book leave out taking care of your own.....face it, you are going to have loved ones and have to live in society so it is really impossible to cut everything off and live to the pure ideas of AR. However the message centering around doing for you is very important....many people get too concerned about what others think about them and as a result, do not live up to their full potneital. Take what you can from this book and live by it by all means...it is good advice!",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Expensive but the only way to get quality, comfort and safety: I previously bought a pair of the cheaper no name units you can see all over Amazon. As many have reported they are very uncomfortable in the shin area, they also pinched my feet across the steel stirrup that is too small for my size 10 boots. Very painful to use, and until you use these better units you don't understand how much more difficult the cheap ones are to use.<br />I then decided to apply some upgrades to the cheaper units. I was able to improve them, but I had to heat the steel up and reshape it, and then I added much more padding to the shin area. Very strong and properly fitting straps were not as easy to find as I expected. I added very wide Velcro banding around the shin area that looked some what like these. I was proud of the improvements until I actually went up to trim trees. Better, but not enough to stop the discomfort and pain and get to a point where I could relax and trust them.<br />I was so sick of them that I came out of the first tree after trimming it and immediately ordered these. So expensive that I really tried to avoid it, but these are a night and day difference in comfort, safety and security. I did have to add a fastener to the already existing holes in the ankle strap and the stirrup to help hold them in place when my weight was not on them, but once that was done I feel like I could climb an 80 foot tree and be safe doing it. Without constant pain.<br />Another huge benefit is the spikes on these units are positioned in a way that makes it much easier to get  a secure stab at the tree when climbing or descending. Plus they are up the stirrup a little so the tips don't grind into whatever you are walking on when you are out of the tree, AND they come with leather spike covers. This alone was almost worth the extra cost.<br />The pros have probably never even tried the cheaper junk, and now I know why. These were cheap for pro level gear but much more expensive than the junk I started with. These should be cheaper to be honest, there is not much too them in materials and the design is pretty obvious to anyone with tree climbing experience. But the cheap ones haven't figured it out, so these are the best value.",5.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Lightweight and easy to clean!: Ordered this item for our back deck.  It is VERY lightweight, so it's easy to pack up and go.  Would be ideal for camping.  It's easy to clean with just a few sweeps with a broom.  It is also stain resistant due to the plastic type of straw that is used (best way I could explain the texture).<br />Again, with it being lightweight, make sure to have something with some weight on it, or it could easily blow away.  I live in a windy area, and this was of concern.  But, it's fine as long as you put something relatively heavy on it.<br />It also comes with a convenient carry bag, to easily stow away or travel with.",4.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,1,25

"This app seems like it's in beta...: General, top-down navigation within the app leaves a lot to be desired. It's very clunky. The search tool is abysmal. You have to scroll left and right to select different letters. It's extremely sluggish and not user friendly.<br /><br />The most annoying thing is the fact that anything you watch frequently stutters. HBO hasn't figured out how to buffer properly. I thought this was a result of my connection, but I streamed content from Netflix and Amazon without any stuttering. Even after rebooting the Fire TV HBO programs still stutter. After Googling the problem I saw that it has been an issue for some time and also affects HBO GO.<br /><br />It's obvious they forced this app out before it was ready. Still, you should try the free 30 day trial and see for yourself. They have redone all of The Wire in widescreen HD and it is awesome.<br /><br />I wouldn't pay $15 a month, though.",1.0,Software,0,27

My perfect bra: I bought this bra because I was looking for a front closure because I had a broken arm and needed something easy to get into. I can't say whether it runs true to size because every bra I buy fits differently. Most of my bras were a 42DD but are always on the last hook. So I bought a 44D. It was perfect. It's really pretty on and easy to hook. I also have narrow shoulders and always have a problem with straps sliding off my shoulders so this REALLY fit my needs. My sister actually asked me where I found this bra. She large breasted and has trouble finding comfortable bras that don't slide off her shoulders.  The width and padding in the straps make it a good choice for big breasted narrow shouldered women. The price is pretty unbelievable for a bra like this.  It feels very high quality.,5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"Truly Horrific, Utterly Gripping: First-off: This is a horror novel. Horrific things happen. People and animals die in terrible ways. If you‚Äôre not okay with that, then you should skip this book. If you‚Äôre okay with that, then I can‚Äôt recommend the book highly enough.<br /><br />This was the first Stephen Graham Jones book I‚Äôve read, but I‚Äôll likely seek out more. The writing style is a bit odd at times, but ultimately compelling and beautiful. I found it hugely original and wildly compelling. I wasn‚Äôt sure where the book was headed. It starts out a little slow, but picks up quite a bit by about a third of the way in. I was fully riveted by the end. I‚Äôd recommend avoiding reading too many plot details ahead of time. It‚Äôs clear while reading the book that something traumatic happened in the past, but the book takes its time revealing exactly what.

"""Our relationship with our closest relative has come a long way since Penny met Koko"": XXXXX<br /><br />‚ÄúHidden in the hills of Northern California, a few miles south of San Francisco, lies Woodside‚Äîone of the wealthiest towns in the United States.  It is home to a host of celebrities including a Western Lowland Gorilla named Koko, whose life challenges what it is that makes humans unique.<br /><br />Over forty years ago, Penny Patterson set out to discover if humans and gorillas could ever communicate.  What began as a Ph.D. to teach sign language to Koko turned into a lifelong relationship.<br /><br />News about Koko made headlines across the world.  But throughout their time together, Penny has had to fight to keep Koko.<br /><br />Now nearly half a century since the project began, the line between humans and apes is being redrawn.  With over 2000 hours of footage, collected over 44 years, does ‚ÄúProject Koko‚Äù finally prove that animals can communicate their thoughts and feelings with humans or are there some things that will always separate us from our closest relative?‚Äù<br /><br />The above is the introduction of this extraordinary documentary.  It tells the true story of Koko, the only ‚Äútalking‚Äù gorilla in the world and her lifelong relationship with her caregiver, animal psychologist Dr. Francine ‚ÄúPenny‚Äù Patterson.<br /><br />Project Koko is the largest running animal language study in history.  It began in 1971 when Koko was born (on July 4) at the San Francisco Zoo.<br /><br />Patterson along with Dr. Ronald Cohn (who has documented Koko‚Äôs life on film) are founders of ‚ÄúThe Gorilla Foundation‚Äù.  This foundation is a non-profit which oversees Koko‚Äôs care and aims to raise awareness for the plight of apes everywhere.<br /><br />What I especially liked about this film is that it considers what the critics of Project Koko have to say.  This is good because it is through debate that science advances.<br /><br />Finally, throughout this documentary are comments from others.  As well, there is interesting archival footage.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is the documentary to get if you‚Äôre a Koko fan (or even if you‚Äôre not).  It gives us a unique window into an incredible relationship!!<br /><br />(2015;  55 min excluding end credits;  6 chapters;  wide screen;  English subtitles;  PBS)<br /><br />&#60;&#60;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada&#62;&#62;<br /><br />XXXXX",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

The hardest part about installation is running the cat5 cable to each camera, but it is still worth the little bit of extra effort to run the cable then to mess around with wifi cameras that don't record a very clear picture most of the time. One of the things I am most impressed with is the fact that I cannot see the wire at all outside my house once I got the cameras mounted. There are lots of configuration options on the DVR, but they are fairly easy to figure out. I am excited to get the Android app installed and set up next.

"Weird, illogical, joke of a plot, not worth your time: I've read Smoak's books before and enjoyed most of them, but this one is too weird. It jumps all over the place, not fully explaining anyIhing and totally not interesting. Nothing that happens is logical or believable. It was so strange, i actually thought she was going to pull a huge surprise and turn it around with a brilliant turn of events in the 2nd half of the book. The surprise was on me. Nothing is ever resolved and the promise of an understandable plot is a  joke. The only conclusion I can come to is Smoak was doing one of two things: either she was writing a story about a girl caught inside a strange video game, or Smoak herself was high on something when she wrote this. The only way she can possibly be getting 4 and 5 star ratings is that she ""bought"" them with offers of free books or whatever. Such a waste of my time and her talent because she is a good writer of some books - just not this one.",1.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"Good if you want disposable pans ... they stick like crazy!: I'm honestly stunned at some of the good reviews of these.  In my 40 some years on this earth, these are by far THE worst pans I've ever used.  The first few times they worked great but I didn't plan this set to be a disposable one.  After just a few weeks, the frying pan especially starting sticking more and more until I literally threw it away.  Yes, I followed the directions of no cooking spray (no explanation as to why this is a rule) and only used the blue non-abrasive scrub pads when needed.  Nevertheless, they still stick.  Even after deciding I was going to throw them away, I thought I'd try using copious amounts of spray oil, you know the stuff we all use effectively with other cookware, and it still stuck.  Forget about cooking eggs!  I feel bad sending these off to the landfill but there is no other choice.  Huge pass on these!",1.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

"Great First Impression: I had purchased and subsequently sent back enclosures from other Mfg's for 8 TB + use cases; returned before even using them and simply on deficient mounting and interface options.<br /><br />This drive enclosure is fabulous at first review and installation.  It has proper securing mounts in the sled for the drive and securely connected to the interface with out any undue pressure; and even very sleek in the case sleeve, with easily accessible ports for power, USB-C and the power switch.<br /><br />Simple, elegant finish on the case keeps it incognito on the server rack  or when under a desk... the link speed of the interface is as advertised, and steps down for backwards capability should you not have USB 3.1 access.<br /><br />After the burn in and some weeks of use I'll return to update the review, but I'd say buy this - this is the best 3.5"" HDD enclosure on the market at this time.<br /><br />I can verify the link speed was negotiated at 3.1 gen 2 on proper ports...  but don't expect anything near that with SATA 3 5400 or 7200 RPM drives.  I see users mixing up link speed (protocol), interface (UBS, internal SATA) expectations.  I actually get better sequential reads with the 56400 rpm drive as opposed to 7200, and that is entirely a drive specific thing.  I'll test SSDs in this at a later point.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"One of the Best TV Shows Ever Made: I really have to hand it to Joss Whedon, this really is an awesome show. I hated Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Also by Joss.) But this... this is pure gold, and cancelled after less than a season? Shame on you Fox. But to make up for it, they gave us this: The boxed set of the entire first season, even the episodes they never aired.<br /><br />But what really makes this show? You might ask. Well, it's the characters. Mal, Kaylee, Jayne; all of them are absolute genius. In their own way they are each funny and interesting and the way they interact seems natural as well as well written. I have not seen characters I have loved so much in a long time, on the same level as characters from good literature.<br /><br />Another thing which makes this show is it's setting, there is an undeniable wild west flavor to the entire show from the firearms to the fiddles and twangs of the soundtrack, to their method of speech. (Which I find extremely charming.)<br /><br />Let us not forget the story! It isn't... outstanding, but it is interesting and keeps you guessing. I had the general flow of the story layed out for me by Serenity (The movie based off of the show.) and it's what got me interested to begin with. But the show still held a lot of surprises. And the setting is in the distant future, when man is colonizing space, the final frontier (I believe this to be the reason for the wild west theming.)<br /><br />I really can't suggest this highly enough if you even remotely like Sci-Fi, a Sci-Fi with no aliens and a somewhat believable vision of the Terran future of mankind.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Smart Move to Read Smart Moves: I am an Academic Advisor at Texas State University and have been in higher education in a variety of other roles supporting students and their families since 1993. I highly recommend reading Reading Smart Moves for Liberal Arts Grads. Doing so will be one of the smartest moves students, career advisors and parents must make because it helps all of them prepare for the world of work. Students will acquire a lot of knowledge and reduce their apprehensions about their career prospects while simultaneously being inspired to do what is necessary to take advantage of the multitude of opportunities long before graduation. Career advisors benefit greatly because they can offer a lot of outside-the-box advice. That is vital especially considering how creative people need to be in order to have a meaningful and fulfilling career. Smart Moves provides many examples of how people were able to achieve their goals. This book provides practical and time-honored advice on how to accomplish that. Parents will be able to support their offspring with up-to-date, helpful information from two long-time professionals in their field. The stories the authors outline are powerful because they illustrate how some of them started down one path but chose another which they eventually benefited from. I highly recommend this book and believe it should be required reading as early in a college academic career as possible. As a matter of fact, high school students can read it so they prepare themselves prior to going to college. In this way, they do not spend valuable time and money on courses they may not have needed and they take courses they enjoy. When students study subjects they enjoy while also being challenged they tend to perform at a higher level.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Absolute Garbage: There are many things wrong with this keyboard, in the first that it's a novel concept, and was directed to be a 'keyboard' marketed towards gamers. I fell for the advertising and spent the first few hours messing with the various configurations and being in awe of the keymapping, but in the end you are still left with a very sub-par product - a rubber dome based keyboard, with folding gimmick top half.<br /><br />It would constantly disconnect from the computer, the drivers had to be reinstalled for it to respond again, it didn't exactly 'work' during bootup other, which forced me to fetch an older keyboard and use that to install Windows..<br /><br />Overall a very shoddy product. If you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 15 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a Das Keyboard.

"Like having a conversation with a compassionate but foul-mouthed friend over drinks: I wish I‚Äôd had this book when I was younger. Tara Schuster recounts how losing her job during the pandemic triggered past trauma that she thought she had already healed. She then shares how she engaged in deeper healing through methods such as therapy, slowing down and getting to know herself better, exploring spirituality, learning to be with her emotions, and setting boundaries. Part memoir and part self-help, this is a sequel to her previous memoir (which I highly recommend), but it stands on its own.<br /><br />Tara swears a lot and uses slang and abbreviations that might confuse or turn off some readers, and her stories sometimes ramble so much they are hard to follow, but I appreciate her authenticity and unique voice. She shares her story with incredible honesty and vulnerability as well as humor and compassion for both herself and others. Reading this book feels like having a conversation with a compassionate but foul-mouthed friend over a few too many drinks.<br /><br />Each chapter includes a suggested healing technique or tips and often resources for further information. I found many of Tara‚Äôs suggestions familiar, but I picked up a few new tips, and repeated exposure to these ideas can be helpful. As someone who often gets bogged down trying to make decisions, I particularly loved Tara‚Äôs tips for reconnecting with your essential self, finding your deepest desires, and conjuring Future You.<br /><br />I think this book could be helpful for many people who are suffering from trauma or mood disorders or just feel unhappy with their current life. Avoid if you dislike swearing, frank discussion of sex and drug use, or books that blend memoir with self-help.<br /><br />I was provided an unproofed ARC through NetGalley that I volunteered to review.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Great garlic press despite flamboyant claims: No, this isn't quite at the level of being a rare work of art, but it is very well made, easy to use, ergonomic garlic press.<br /><br />I've had, and used, many different garlic presses in my life. Usually, they just get the job done, but nothing to write home about. This press, however, is better. The curves to the handles, the width of the lower handle, contribute to it being comfortable in the hand, and actually being a simple joy to use.<br /><br />The pedestal pushing part stops the bulb from sliding around, or off to the side, and it has a limited range of motion (arcing).

"Different: At first I was disappointed that I had purchased this first box set. Especially after I had finished the first book, and felt that it was not really anything more than a preamble in which we meet the various characters in the story.  As the box set progressed, I became involved in a different kind of story where we have various governmental entities composed primarily of a partnership of noble houses United under a military dictatorship established by Armcore.  Non-partners include a free trade group called the Trader's Belt, and a few independent worlds of minor significance. El is a scion of one of the partner noble houses who steals a weaponized racer, and blazes his own independent path of resistance against Armcore as a pirate. In the process we discover a conflict between two AI's for control of the universe.  One works for Armcore, and the other is independent. Everything is kind of ho hum until we are introduced to this ancient race that took a different path of development that leaves them totally alien and not understandable because their development relies upon organic development of their civilization, space ships, weapons, etc. This box set concludes with a mission to kill the independent AI, and perform a rescue presumably the goal of the next boxed set.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"OVER 22 CHANNELS Received at Friend's House, though NO Signal at Mine ~~!!: Bought this excellent portable TV and was quite excited to have something for emergencies.  Unfortunately, no signal was available where I live, which is down a hillside, and below other condo buildings.  After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I needed to know whether this was a location problem, which it is.<br /><br />Took this little TV over to a friend's house, right on the lake, without any obstructions to block signals.  The TV scanned/saved over 22 channels, which is exactly what my friend gets with a larger Digital Antenna for free reception on full sized televisions.  This RCA receives exactly the same number of channels with its built-in antenna.<br /><br />Beautiful picture, good sound, and quite sturdy case, with excellent viewing screen.  The little pop out stand is sturdy enough if it isn't jammed around clumsily, and holds the set up just fine on a tilt.<br /><br />I had to returned this TV only because I cannot get any reception, but can attest that it will indeed receive where there is enough open space, without buildings or hillsides in the way.<br />Interestingly, this RCA 'remembered' the 22+ channels scanned at my friend's house, and tried to receive here, also.  Possibly<br />the prior problem mentioned by another reviewer, having to scan each time it is turned on, has been corrected, I wonder . ..  or possibly, 'save' was not selected after scanning . . .",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"My review comparing several masks: This review compares several different masks that I‚Äôve purchased; both surgical and KF94.  I‚Äôm hoping it will help others make a decision.  I wear glasses and am in New England, so I will be giving their ability to not fog my glasses extra credit.<br />First, I‚Äôll cover the surgical masks.  Unfortunately, the best surgical masks I got were from Harbor Freight before the pandemic, they had a real, large, wire in the nose, new ones from Harbor Freight do not.  Now all of them have twist tie wires, i.e single small gauge wire with a flat plastic coating.  Bend a twist tie around your finger and see how well it stays, it will bounce back on you.  I‚Äôve purchased Hatrigo Class 1 and Comix.  The Hatrigo masks have a weaker nose piece that won‚Äôt keep their shape, so I won‚Äôt be getting those any more.  I found Comix Disposable Face masks hold shape better; but, the second batch I ordered wasn‚Äôt as good as the first batch in terms of fit.<br />Second, I‚Äôll cover the KF94 masks.  I haven‚Äôt cut open most of these and the reason they hold better on the nose is because they have 2 larger gauge wires with the same flat plastic coating.  So two larger in KF94 vs one smaller in the surgical masks.  The Care ON basic KF94s collapse when you breath in, i.e., they aren‚Äôt stiff enough to hold their boat shape.  This makes them difficult to breathe through.  The nose piece is ok, but not great. They are also smaller in shape.  LG Health Care Airwasher KF94 is larger and has a stiffer nose piece but is harder to breath through than the next two I‚Äôm listing.  It does keep its shape when you breath in.  It also has adjustable ear loops which helps.  The BOTN/TIA in black holds its shape when you breath in and is easier to breathe through than the Airwasher.  Otherwise, it‚Äôs about the same.  Also has a good nose piece but neither is perfect for stopping fogging in cold weather.  Bluna Face Fit to me is the same as the BOTN/TIA in most ways; keeps its shape when you breath in and decent nose piece.<br />Mask Lanyards.  One thing that really helped with the overall fit is buying a Mask Lanyard, I bought a set from TEKcians.  They allow you to put the loops around the back of your head instead of your ear, which allows the face mask to fit MUCH better.  It allows the following combinations: 1. both loops above the ear, 2. one loop above the ear and one loop below (but not pulling at the back of the ear anymore because it‚Äôs tight around the back of the head, or 3. both under the ear. The both under the ear may be the best for preventing glasses from fogging but it also puts a fair amount of pressure on the bridge of your nose.  These lanyards are slightly stretchy which helps with pulling them onto your face, and you can adjust the length easily.<br />I hope this review helps.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"Lots of fun - at least the way we use it: I picked up one of these metal detectors back in April, when they were on sale as a Lightening Deal. Years ago I had owned a metal detector and remembered we had a lot of fun using it - so I thought this might be neat to play with this summer.  (And I was apparently right.)<br /><br />The metal detector I had over 20 years ago had been made of metal and had been pretty heavy (not to mention the weight all the C batteries it took to power it. This one by Winbest is very light, almost to the point it feels like a toy (several people asked me if it was a real metal detector after picking it up and discovering how light it is). Part of the reason for the light weight is this unit is powered by two 9-volt batteries - the main reason is it's made mostly out of plastic and aluminum. I like that it is so light weight, as that makes it easy to carry around and young kids can use it with no problems (the shaft length is adjustable which is good for kids who might be a bit lower to the ground than an adult).<br /><br />The metal detector comes disassembled - so there is some assembly required. Nothing too complicated, just attaching a few parts to other parts, and you don't even need any tools - everything screws together with knobs designed to be tightened with your fingers.<br /><br />Operation of this metal detector is pretty straight forward - you adjust the sensitivity and then sweep the head of the detector back and forth till you hear a squeal indicating the head is over some sort of metal. There are three knobs that control things - a volume knob for setting how loud the squeal will be (there is a headphone jack if you prefer to not bother other people), a knob for setting how sensitive the detector is (set too high and you get a lot of false positives), and a knob for adjusting what sort of metal the detector will detect (I recommend keeping this on the default setting). Plus there is an analog meter that displays a scale from 0-10 (if I remember right it's an indication of how strong a signal is - or how big a piece of metal is. I never really look at it as the sound of the squeal will tell you pretty much the same thing.)<br /><br />I can say we used this detector quite a bit this spring - when my relatives came down and stayed in one of the local RV parks I loaned it to them and they had a blast with it - even though they mainly just found old soda/beer can pull-tops. I think it's the possibility of discovering something of value that is what makes for the thrill.<br /><br />One thing I should mention - if you get a metal detector, don't use it around the outside of your home - or at least not within say 10 feet of it. The reason for that recommendation is that when houses get built there is a lot of trash left behind. So if you do explore near your house - expect to find a lot of bent nail, and other pieces of metal debris.<br /><br />We came up with a game using this metal detector. I have about a dozen of the old Eisenhower dollar coins (culls with the cladding flaking off), and we hide them in the grass and have someone try to find them within a set amount of time. Simple little game, but you would be surprised at how evolved people get playing it (not only the kids, the adults too).<br /><br />This metal detector can detect metal to about a 6"" depth - least that has been my experience with the one I bought. Which is fine with me, the soil here is hard clay and you don't really want to dig a lot of holes (even small ones) deeper than that. The detector head is water proof - but I wouldn't use it in anything deeper than a few inches.<br /><br />So to wrap it up, I really am happy I bought this metal detector when I did - it's been a fun activity this summer, even if we  didn't find any buried treasure (yet).<br /><br />Just in case it might be of interest to anyone, the box this comes in is big - but not overly large, 23 1/2"" x 4 1/2"" x 8"".<br /><br />Review for - Winbest by Barska Pro Edition Metal Detector model BE11638",5.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,1,25

"Great option for weekend on a budget: I got mine at Target for $129. We packed it for 2 people, so a package of hot dogs, bacon and eggs, misc chilled snacks etc, and filled it with roughly 30lbs of ice.  Somewhere around 80% ice, 20% food.<br /><br />I kept it in the back of a jeep (so not as hot as the back of a car) during 90high, 80 low, jeep in direct sun most of the day.  We paid attention to keeping it closed but definitely weren‚Äôt totally efficient with it and opened it quite a bit at food time.<br /><br />After the second morning it had plenty of ice, the bacon and eggs were still safely chilled, and nothing was quite floating. Frozen yogurt strips were melted but still quite cold.<br /><br />Once home I decided to experiment and just set it in the living room and left it for the next few days.  On the afternoon of day 6, unopened since day 3, it was all water but measured exactly 40 degrees.<br /><br />So this isn‚Äôt a Yeti but it did well for its purpose.

"Amazing: Amazing read! Wow. Makes you think, a lot. I quickly started caring about Hanneke and admired her determination and courage. War brings out so many different parts of our humanity. Hanneke reminds us of the need to harden oneself and look for every way to survive. The story is written so well that you feel pangs in the heart with agonizing loss and hope. It is beautiful that our basic need to love and be loved does not disappear. Ollie is an unsung hero. He is good to the core and I so very much liked him. Judith and Mina are wonderful and thankfully people like Mina left us evidence of the atrocities. I appreciated all the characters and the detail given to them, their roles, and to their surroundings. These teenagers and young adults had to tackle issues and situations that are too complicated for adults. The story was true to emotions dominating until someone managed to steady the situation and be a voice of reason. Anger, frustration, fear, forgiveness, love, bravery and much more were well portrayed. It was incredible how well written the story is and how I did not want to put it down.

"JEFF BECK IS  BIG HITTER ON STUNNING BOX SET: 'Beckology' is an outstanding collection of 'the best' of Jeff Beck going back to his pre-Yardbirds days up through the 90s. What you see here is the long-box version, where the box is like a guitar case (even the inside imagery of plus velvet has the impression of a guitar having been pressed against it) housing 3 CDs and a long-format booklet on Jeff that includes the Pete Frame Family Tree diagrams detailing the various JB groups up to a point. IMO this is one of the best, cleverest and creative of any box set packaging I've seen. I focus on the packaging because the long-box is highly collectible, having been replaced by a square box (and thus the loss of the guitar case format and now only a 'short' booklet). But the music - even the really early stuff - is great, offering as it does a narrative that reveals why Jeff was such an influence of the likes of Hendrix, Satriani, Vai, SRV and - per Sir Macca's guitar solo on George Harrion's 'Taxman' - even Sir Paul. But long-box or short-box, get it. It's a musical adventure from start to finish.",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

There must have been a short-circuit that made it constantly change my phone settings as I was working out.  I decided to give these headphones a second chance.<br /><br />The second pair has a serious problem with static buildup. I got a nasty shock in my ear and started having problems with my phone. Humidity was 50% that day, so I don't see how I could wear these during winter months, even indoors.<br /><br />Despite feeling like they are only halfway in, I never had a problem with these headphones falling out.

"Absolutely weird fitting and what the heck is a ZUTY?: My wife picked this up as she was looking for a pair of comfortable casual pants to wear while running errands and whatnot.  The color is nice and the pants ARE comfortable, but that's about all the positives.  The fit is weird, some parts are tight, some parts are loose, the length is also slightly shorter than expected.  The material, while comfortable, runs pretty hot, especially in the sun and didn't seem that breathable at all.  The worst part though...what the heck is a ZUTY?  She kind of wished they didn't display so boldly on the pants.<br /><br />Honestly, you're probably better off getting a nice pair of Adidas or Nike or Lululemons or whatever.  $30 for a non-branded item is rather steep.

It has small bumps that catch both my daughter's and wife's hair; oh an it even catches the hair from our fur babies. It's fairly simple to clean and remove the hair, easier when it's dry. The only drawback is that the water flow down the drain slows down due to the small holes surrounding it causing a small amount of water to back up.

"Best brushed WB Urethane - Hands Down: I've been an avid woodworker for over 30 years.  I used to spray almost all of my finishes until I found GF EF urethane.  The last several cabinet projects that I've done have turned out terrific because of this product.  I get a smooth handed rub look with little effort.  This products got rave reviews from Fine Woodworking a number of years ago, and that's when I made the change.  One of the previous reviewers used it outside on teak.  They used an interior product outside, so their results aren't surprising.  The product clearly states that it for INTERIOR use.  You have to read the label.  GF has an exterior product called Exterior 450.<br /><br />What I like about this product, is that it goes on easily, dries quickly and you can sand it inside of one hour and get a nice white powder.  I use the satin finish, yet I can rub it out and get a low luster satin finish, OR if I rub it out with 1200 or 1600 grit, I can get a high gloss, hand rubbed piano finish.  I've compare the last several cabinet projects to a factory finish and GF process that I've refined blows them away.  This is a wonderful product backed by a company where people actually pick up the phone to answer question.  I highly recommend it for the woodworking enthusiast.  You will never go back to spraying solvent based products.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"Good quality case with only a few flaws.: The good:<br />-Fits my Transformer T300 with keyboard really well.<br />-The case protects my tablet and accessories reasonably well.<br />-There are plenty of pockets inside and out.<br />-The zipper seems durable and opens and closes fine/no force was needed.<br />-The color red is just like the picture and looks great. It's not too bright or dark.<br />-The handles feel comfortable and durable.<br />-Doesn't feel heavy or bulky.<br /><br />The bad:<br />-The adjustable pad strip inside is almost useless. Although adjustable, it doesn't tighten or snuggle properly against the tablet. It does seem to add a little protection since it is padding. However, there is another strap inside that tightens the tablet securely, not padded.<br />-Although it was a lot of pockets, you can't fit much in them without smooshing things and have them bulge out the bag. I was able to cram a miniature wired mouse, 4 stylus/ink pens, cleaning cloth, power adapter inside while storing my cell phone in the outside pocket.<br /><br />I would recommend this to carry only your tablet and a few accessories. This is not a mini-briefcase or luggage. You can only fit so much inside. I'd recommend buying a sleeve so you have the option to leave everything home and only take your tablet. I actually bought a red sleeve at the Dollar Tree that was meant for an iPad but fit my Asus Transformer w/Keyboard fine.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with the quality and it has just enough space while remaining compact.<br />I would recommend this item.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"Even the arsonist said, ""enough already."": I had decided to appropriate an opening for this review, something I thought pithy, poignant and pertinent, like ‚ÄúIt was the best of books, it was the worst of books, it was the book of wisdom, it was the book of foolishness, it was about the epoch of belief, it was about epoch of incredulity, it was a tale of Light, it was a tale of Darkness, it was the instigation of hope, it was the descent to despair‚Ä¶‚Äù then I realized, beyond tangentially plagiarized, it would also be nearly as self-indulgent as the effort it alluded to.<br /><br />For any who has in the past, criticized a story for inadequately developed characters, this is the book that may make you wax nostalgic for perfunctory treatments. I can‚Äôt recall a single central character I would consider less than fully fleshed out, as well as far more of the secondary characters than one would typically expect. In fact, if a book nutritionist evaluated this story and applied a narrative version of the Body Mass Index scale, most of these characters would be assessed morbidly obese.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt think after reading a few pages of this text anyone would dispute the author is immensely talented. There is phrasing and similes that will leave you smiling, on a multiplicity of levels envious of his wordsmithing and intuitiveness even as you begin to imagine yourself as a reader caught in bear trap without any clearly identifiable way to gnaw off your foot to escape (Yeah, I‚Äôm one of those pathetic types that still believes you are obligated to finish any book you begin).<br /><br />Finally, after about 650 pages of text with pacing as interesting as watching someone attempting ot apply honey oak stain over a mahogany finish, the illusion the pace is going to accelerate appears and for 50 pages or so, you are invigorated but that mirage fades and you are left with the deflating recognition you still have 250 pages more of authorial extraneous exposition to go, with full recognition the denouement is not likely to deliver any sense of satisfaction for your tenacity.<br /><br />And lamentably, your speculations are proven precise.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Excellent Gift: Making a magical apocalyptic manhattan is, at best, a long shot. The majority of these media types are destined to fail before they begin. As an avid manga and anime fan, i judge books by their covers(at least the back preview). When making my way through a local stores manga section, I spied, amongst the plain white backed character portraits, a dysmal reddish sky with a melancholic young man and one bold word, Wizard. I stopped, arms full of all 12 Death note volumes, and gazed at its wonderful cover. I balanced the other manga and picked it up to read the back. I then set it down and purchased my manga. Two weeks later, i found it again. This time i flipped through it. I felt like i got slapped. This wonderful work of art I had ignorantly set down jumped at me liked Harry potter never could. I purchased it and read it on the way home. I was intrigued by its story and couldnt stop. The art was immersive and the story gripping. No amount of wand waving could match these wizards.

"absolutely beautiful: I was initially a bit hesitant to spend so much money on a purse, but I just couldn't resist the design. I'm so glad I went for it, because this may be the most beautiful purse I've ever owned. The craftmanship is exquisite, and the hardware is lovely, although the magnetic snap closure seems a bit on the cheap side compared to the other bits. I am not a huge fan of magnetic snap closures as they seem to eventually tear away from the flap after much use. But, I understand why it was necessary to preserve the design of this gorgeous bag, and as there is an inner zip, it may not matter too much in the end. I love that this comes with two straps so you can use it as a cross-body or a hand/evening bag without having to double up a bulky strap. I'm tempted to get the purple version of this for a darker mood, but that seems a bit extravagant at the moment, so I'm just going to love on this one for a bit.<br /><br />edit: This is a leather purse, and one should take as much care of it as one would with a pair of leather shoes, and expect the same behavior: the longer you own it, the more you will love it. This purse will require a period of 'breaking in', and you may be surprised that it will finally hold everything you need one day. It's a 'lifetime-bag'.  It has been made with wonderful craftmanship, exactly how purses 'used to be made'. I am so impressed.",5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"Excellent writing, overused plot ideas: Yes, if you've ever read a fantasy book before, you can almost tell the story before you read this.

I seriously sat down for a few minutes and wracked my brain because I thought maybe I must have read this before.<br /><br />!!!!!!BUT......<br /><br />the writing is EXCELLENT. I have rarely come to identify with and love any characters so quickly and completely as I did with this book.  It is true that there was not a single twist in the story that was a surprise to me, BUT I would have been upset if there had been, because I REALLY wanted the characters to have a happy ending.<br /><br />And the rest of this series only gets better.  I highly recommend that any serious fantasy fan read this book, if only to become acquainted with the characters so that you can better enjoy the rest of the books in the series.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Best carrier out there!: I've been using my Ergo for over a year and a half and couldn't live without it! My first daughter was fairly fussy and for a long time, would only nap if being carried. I started with the Baby Bjorn but quickly found that her weight put too much pressure on my shoulders and caused me to quickly become uncomfortable when carrying her. My sister in law recommended the Ergo and I couldn't believe the difference. Because the Ergo is designed to put most of a baby's weight on the carrier's hips, it allowed me to carry my daughter for long periods of time without becoming sore or tired. My first daughter is nearly two and I still carry her frequently on my back using the Ergo. She rides in the Ergo when we take daily walks and I'm able to carry her comfortable for a number of miles. Now that I also have an infant, I carry my toddler in the Ergo when going grocery shopping which works great to keep her contained and allows me to keep my second child in the carseat in the cart basket.

This is only a kit and the builder should expect resolving problems during construction.: The wood selection externally was excellent quality but I have to end the praise there.<br /><br />This was a very high priced kit relative to others but it had some serious problems that I had to resolve.  Mainly the pre prepared bridge placement holes required a major relocation which required filling them with dowell rods and redrilling.  Unfortunately I discovered this after I placed the guitar finish at final assembly.  I would have exchanged the kit but I was too far into the project at that point so I resolved it‚Äôs issues and repairing the finish.  The neck location ended up being spot on and I substituted many of the supplied components to suit my interests.  In the end it turned out great but I wish the  instructions provided some guidance of what to look for in building this kit.

"Expensive, but ADDICTINGLY DELICIOUS: I recently tried the Peanut Butter Banana Dark Chocolate KIND Breakfast Protein Bars, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good they were.<br /><br />The bars are a great breakfast or snack option for people who are always on the go because they are simple to grab and carry. Additionally, they are loaded with protein and other healthy ingredients, so I feel good about choosing them as a snack.<br /><br />Dark chocolate, peanut butter, and banana make for a really delicious and satisfying flavor combination. The bars have a pleasant texture that isn't overly chewy or crunchy, and there's no odd aftertaste.<br /><br />The only reason I gave these bars four instead of five stars is because they are a little too sweet for my taste. I like that they use honey and maple syrup as natural sweeteners, but I still think they're a little too sugary.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a nutritious and delectable snack, I'd highly suggest the KIND Breakfast Protein Bars. Just prepare yourself for a little sweetness!",4.0,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,1,14

Good writing and some great acting.  Logan Lehrman is really stepping up his acting and his character was more likable this season than season 1.  Carol Kane steals every scene.  Amazing actress.  And Greg Austin did an excellent smooth talking psychopath.  The rest of the cast did a great job as well.

Nice video quality: This is the third action camera I have owned.  A GoPro 2 and a Campark X20.  The video quality of this camera is a ton better than the Campark .

The EIS seems to do a good job. While not perfect it does help with stabilizing the shot.<br />The sound quality is not the greatest but it is okay.  The accessories it comes with are really nice.<br />The one thing I don't like is the support of Akaso.  They do not have firmware upgrades for their cameras.

The small tube is big enough for anyone in our family to use.. From age 3 on up to age 50 and the large one is big enough for an adult and one of our children.  The tubes are super fun and work great in snow.  We had between 3-6"" of snow and were able to use the snow tubes in our front yard.  The kids loved them and so did we.

"A ripping lesson through the whole Earache back catalouge: Yep, the crazed Grindheads from ANB have truly out-done themselves this time. Where do I start? This is beyond insane. It's loud, obnoixious, obscene, vulgar, disgusting, demented, psychotic, sarcastic, and it will definately make you want to go out and ""set fire to a schoolbus full of rich white kids"". Agoraphobic Nosebleed truly know how to make good-use out of a drum machine that sounds like a innocent bystander being anally raped by a jackhammer. Scott Hull's guitar is nothing but lethal. Even more impressive than his sound on Pig Destroyer's ""Prowler In The Yard"" album(IMO, a new milestone in Grindcore). The demented samples themselves just gives this extreme album a true avant-garde feeling to it. Agoraphobic Nosebleed have some guests on this album such as J.R. Hayes(Pig Destroyer), Killjoy(Necrophagia), Pete (Benumb) and even Danny Lilker who not even plays bass on a cover song of the legendary Nuclear Assault song ""Hang the Pope"", but as well spews out some truly disgusting vocals. Excellent cover I add. The cover artwork is even killer. Other songs worth mentioning are the insane Techno-programmed blast beat-o-rama ""Hungry Homeless Handjob"" with it's misanthopic lyrics, the truly disturbing ""Chalking The Temporal God Module"", and the hilarious Trip-Hop sounding ""Fxckmaker"" which Scott Hull is being poked fun at but in a good way.

"Great psu, but be careful what cables you use: I got the 1000w psu because I upgraded to a 3070 ti. Works great, but ran into issues trying to use the cables from the old corsair sf600 psu. The modular cables are not swappable because the blank pins are in different locations. You have to use the cables that come with the psu or nothing will power on.

Poorly made: I purchased this item and only used it three times before the stem with the hose fittings to connect to gauges popped out.  I disassembled the unit and found that the threads were stripped off of the stem and pulled out of the block that appeared to me made of some type of pot aluminum or something.  I was able to tap deeper into the block and cut the stem and re thread that.  Then the fitting that the air hose connects to pulled out.  Was unable to tap that piece out deeper because of the venturi so I had to JB Weld it into the block so that I could use it.  I had to pull a vacuum and had no other options since this was the only pump I had and didn't think it would just fall apart.  Very disappointed and ordering a Robin Air pump.,1.0,Automotive,0,4

You know this type of wood will have threads that will make sanding it a bit difficult, but the brushes go everywhere and if you need to renew or prepare this wood to be painted, you can save a lot of time with a brush.<br />These brushes work great on rust, but don't expect to make it shine, for some reason the last layer of rust is super attached to metals and the only way is sanding that last layer.<br />All in all great product, great price for this amount of brushes.<br />Hope this was helpful, thank you so much.",5.0,Industrial_and_Scientific,1,19

Felo 400 series: You wont go wrong or be disappointed with and of Felo's products. In my experience they are made very well with precise tips and quality craftsmanship. They are a 5 star product.<br />  With that said the 400 series arent my favorite. The ergonic handle is a bit soft which makes it very comfortable to use but on construction sites it has a tendency to get damaged. The Felo 550 series are my everyday use drivers.  Like the 550 the 400 have a solid core handle and bex bolster.  Both have some heft to them which I prefer rather than a light weight screwdriver.,5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30
"Great limited ingredient treat: Our French Bulldog loves these treats. They look really cute - like waffles almost.

The only wish I had was that the salmon and oat treats would have no chicken meal in them.

I don't want to spoil the story for you so suffice it to say that ""The Sphinx"" is a terrific character with an excellent story. In my opinion Jeff Weigel should be a household name in households where comic books are loved and appreciated for the joys only they can deliver.

"Great value for money, don't expect perfection: I was interested in a body vibration machine. Not willing to spend >$1000 on my first foray into this technology.<br />Just bought the Crazy Fit. Note: Mine has 50 speed levels.<br /><br />Red Flag Caution: These units are NOT tested/approved under FCC, UL or CSA safety standards. There is no standard (and required?) manufacturers plate indicating voltage, model number, serial number, etc. There are no labels of any kind where you would expect them on something sold in the US or Canada. There is no FCC Class A or Class B label. On the unit itself, there is not even a ""Made in China"" label. Nothing at all to indicate type of product, model, serial, safety or anything. Knocked a star for this, but this could make this product totally unsuitable for some, especially if children are around, or you live in a potentially ""flammable"" environment. That may be why instructions say ""unplug after use"". Seriously bad flaw.<br /><br />Summary: Works as expected, I am sure there are better vibrators, especially ones that have pivot, etc, but for under $200, this was great machine to test out the concept.<br /><br />Instructions: Chinglish all the way. Lots of awkward language as ""Do not put the finger or eyewinker into gap in case of risk of injury"". But mostly understandable.<br /><br />Assembly: No instructions to speak of. I figured it out in about 20 minutes. All the screws are already in position, just remove them to add a component. Some tips: The vertical bars point away from the center post when you insert them. When you thread the wire for the base, tape it down before you bolt in the center post, as if it falls into the hole, good luck getting it back out. The wires for the left/right arms align left right with the ribbon cable when you put the top plate on. Common sense there. (this will make sense if you put one together!)<br /><br />Build quality: My guess is the Chinese did what they are best at, copied something that is well made and figure out how to make a reasonable copy while scrimping on every possible component you can save money on. The top plate/control panel is made of super cheap plastic. LOL I read several reviews complaining about missing parts, or broken pieces. Mine were all included, but the paint on the vertical center bar was poorly done with holes in the paint.  For under $200, I don't really care.<br />Otherwise, the base is solid, and when everything is tightened up, even under high speeds, it does not excessively vibrate. Instructions say to tighten all the bolts every couple months, good advice.<br /><br />Functionality: Works almost as well as the $1600 unit I tested in a studio prior to buying this. No complaints. My goal was to buy this as a test, and if I am still using it in 12 months, upgrade to a Zaaz, or whatever is considered best at the time.<br /><br />Use: I got this as a supplement to exercise, heard that vibration machines can give the body great tone when used with normal exercise, without hundreds of extra hours in the gym. With the first few workouts, I can feel the buttocks and abs tighten up, so its very promising on that front.<br /><br />I think vibration technology is fantastic for invalids, people in very poor physical condition, on walkers, etc. I wish my uncle had one of these before he became totally bed-ridden.<br /><br />I can't comment on the crazy fit vs. other cheapo imitations, but for those who want to test out a vibration machine without committing the money for a top of the line machine, feel free to get this. Whether it's worth the price for a top of the line vs. this Crazy Fit, I will try to figure out in a year or so.<br /><br />If the other ""imitation"" units being sold are properly UL approved, etc., I would like to know.",4.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

Sound great but not comfortable.: The sound is incredible. Strong bass that's adjustable but the sparkle of nuances still shines through.<br />Uncomfortable to wear for long periods and don't sit very deep so I can't lay down while wearing them which is a big turn off.

Middle aged Mutant Ninja Turtle: The size is much smaller than American sizes.  The XXL fit like a Large.  Luckily I only bought it as part of my Halloween costume and only wore it once but after trick or treating with my kids I gave it to my wife who is petit.  It‚Äôs not the greatest quality and the green fuzz from the sweatshirt got all over my clothes even after having washed it in cold water before wearing it.  There was no ‚ÄúM‚Äù initial on the belt graphic but there are nunchaku printed on the back as if in the holsters.  It could be Michelangelo or just some ran-dumb ninja turtle who also uses nunchaku.<br />Also be advised there are no pockets on this hoodie or at least there were none on mine.  If you want to wear it regularly then go spend the extra money to buy one from Spencer Gifts or Hot Topic.  If you do purchase this be sure to order it at least one size larger than you actually wear.  I wear XXL just fine with a little extra room (I like my hoodies to fit large) but wearing this XXL it looked like my shell was on the front.  Two stars is being generous.,2.0,Toys_and_Games,0,31

"Not as illustrated: I bought this for a little over $3 just to get the pin-type watch band adapters. In the product illustration they're shown to be metal and to include ""nightstick"" shaped pins with pegs. The product I received had black plastic ones with weird generic pins I had to cut to remove. It takes 12mm/13mm pins aka ""half inch"" vintage size bands and as you can read in some other reviews the adapters aren't a very tight fit into the fitbit either. I'm keeping them but I can't say I'm satisfied with my purchase, even for $3.<br /><br />Edited to add: I went to modify these connectors and when I took my dremel to them I discovered that they are, in fact, metal underneath the very thick black enamel coating and a pretty hard metal too. They have proven to be somewhat unreliable and come unsnapped a couple, three times while I was wearing them but I'm still buying two more because they are absolutely worth the price as adapters to attach regular watch bands and bracelets to a Luxe (which I've now equipped the rest of my family with). We'll see if the new ones are black or silver I guess, but I bet they'll be black despite being illustrated as silver.",3.0,Electronics,0,12

Other over-ear design earbuds don't fit or hurt the back of my ears, but these are barely noticeable while delivering the same amount of stability. The rubber pads that go into the ear are also incredibly comfortable and don't rub or squeeze my ear canal the way others frequently do. So far I haven't been using them for too long so can't say much about longevity of the product.

Clay is clearly in his elements and this is definitely going to be my all time favourite every time Christmas comes around.<br /><br />His voice is crisp and clear, and his joy and jubilation comes through convincingly. ""Mary did you know"" bears special mention because it was absolutely mesmerising.<br /><br />In all, a captivating album well worth every cent. This album will make me wait with bated breath for his next.<br /><br />Clay has indeed redeemed himself with this album. His debut was, how should I put it, nondescript and a waste of his talent.<br /><br />But he is clearly king of the heap with this one.<br /><br />Get it, it's a great addition to any Christmas collection, proving that the songs don't have to be different to make it good when the voice is good enough.",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Great case for a great price.: I had originally tried the juice force charge case that charges your phone... Unfortunately, it did charge the battery but did not have the built in magnets to hold it to the magnetic mophie car charger that I bought as well.  After trying a second one with the same fate, I opted for this case that does not charge the phone but allows wireless charging thru the case and has the magnetic properties that allow it to charge and connect to the mophie magnetic car charger.  My only complaint is that if you want to turn the phone sideways, you have to turn the magnetic charger sideways as well due to placement of the internal magnets.  But that was minor as my charger rotates sideways pretty easily.  The case is well built and protects the case completely. It fits the iPhone 8plus perfectly.

My stuffy nose gets clearer faster & the night drink helps me sleep more soundly without my symptoms hardly bothering me. It tastes really nice too; I truly recommend this!",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16
"Starrett been making great hole saw kits for year: I have used many brands of hole saws for year. Starrett, Lenox , Mk Morse are all great brands. These work great in wood and mild steel. This kit is very handy for any shop. I checked Amazon for pricing hole saw kits and the Mk Morse AV100 kit has a few more sizes and it is a little less money. For this reason I gave this kit 4 stars.

The sleeve provides a very snug fit for my iphone (you really have to push it in there). However, I actually have a tight silicone sleeve over my iphone making it too big to fit into the Skque sleeve. The Skque is about 12cm by 6.5cm (if you place it on top of your iphone it's the exact same size so I was a bit worried that it wouldn't fit). I read other reviews about similar sleeves on the market with customers also commenting that it doesn't fit with the silicone cover and I was surprised as a silicone sleeve is so tight, but it actually does make a huge difference.",3.0,Electronics,0,12

From establishing purpose to providing practical and useful rubrics, this guide is a great introduction for those new to assessment practice or for those seeking additional resources.  Learning Assessment Techniques takes readers through the entire assessment cycle, from establishing goals to evaluating effectiveness.  Most assessment texts are geared towards K-12, so this is a refreshing addition to my office library.  In an age of data-driven decision and budget making, this guide will help you and your department effectively create and evaluate course-level assessments.  The rubrics are helpful, and there are enough examples for me to pick and choose what works best for my department and course.  Also included are the American Association of Colleges and Universities value rubrics, and it's great to have all of these in one book.  Also, there are numerous examples of assessments for a wide range of subjects.  Very useful resource!",5.0,Books,1,7

"Finally found a great mulching blade!: I have bought various so called mulching blades which cost more than this and seemed to do very little mulching so I bought this product with some hesitation.  To my great delight they worked incredible well.  The design is radically different from regular blades and they do the job, especially when it comes to cleaning up the fall leaves.  They are heavier than normal mower blades but simple to put on - no different than installing a regular set of blades.  I use a bagging lawn mower and the number of times I had to empty the bags was dramatically reduced due to the fact that these blades chop up the leaves into small pieces.  Besides taking less time to clean the leaves, they will not blow back into your yard since the pieces are too small for the wind to push them around.  These blades seem to work even better if the leaves are damp or slightly wet.  I bought these primarily to clean up the fall leaves but I will never use a regular lawn mower blade again since they are also great for just regular lawn mowing.",5.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,1,25

"Sturdy woven band: I am so impressed with the look of this woven apple watch band. I usually do not like the rigidness of a buckle band but somehow, maybe because it is woven, this seems to work. The color of the black with white woven in gives it a very handsome dress look yet does not look out of place as a casual band. Attaching the band to my watch was simple. It slipped on easily after pressing on the button at the back of my watch. It has held up very well to the daily grind at work.  I work as a carrier for the post office and my bands get a lot of abuse sliding against parcels and mailboxes, not to mention all kinds of weather.<br /><br />Bottom line: Goodidus woven nylon replacement band has proven to hold up well, with no fraying from constant rubbing against objects (at work). The buckle looks like it might be plastic but is has taken repeated abuse and still doing well.

"4 stars -- adventurous and sweet: The ""Abduction Scenario"" isn't unknown in JAFF, but its execution is variable. This one, however, is very sweet, adventurous, romantic, funny and touching. I would recommend it to anyone because it's also clean (though there are kisses and snuggling, so beware, lolz).<br /><br />I particularly liked the way that Darcy and Elizabeth interact in this book. Their banter was sarcastic, dry and made me laugh several times. Also, even if there were some misunderstandings, they only lasted long enough for the couple to talk it out honestly. And if they argued, it didn't necessarily become melodramatic; if anything, they behaved in the opposite manner. In short, they were reasonable people who didn't act like cheesy soap opera actors.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />There was only one small part that didn't work for me, hence the deduction of a star. After ODC has escaped to safety in London, the magistrate asks them for help in drawing out one of the criminals who had abducted them. Okay, I'm on board so far. Elizabeth has to do it? Fine, that works. He has to come all the way to the Darcy townhouse and essentially confess to attempting to blackmail Darcy before they can arrest him? Huh? They already know that the guy is guilty of abducting them in addition to being a rather notorious criminal already, so why the convoluted plot to entrap him? It makes no sense. If they knew where he was already, then they shouldn't even need ODC to lure him out, either. Don't get me wrong, it was a fun ploy, but it just didn't fit with this plot. Otherwise, I didn't have any issues with the narrative.<br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />I also really liked the epilogue. Not to give even more away, but the author did an excellent job of redeeming one of the conspirators. It was very heartwarming to see him make something respectable of himself instead of the usual ""karma eventually caught up with him"" ending we're all used to.

Diamond food is less expensive and still has much better ingredients than most other expensive dog foods. I simply can not say enough wonderful  things about this food. I buy one 40lb bag a month for 2 medium sized dogs. I save money because I only need to feed them once a day and they are full all night. With other brands they were hungry again halfway through the evening so I would have to feed them twice a day. They are trained to scratch at the dog food container when they want to eat. They only do that once a day now!! Its so nice! My vet told me my old food was like feeding my dog McCdonalds everyday.

Rhia is learning some hard truths but remains struggling in the dark about everything that is going on. But she has enough fight to not be a doormat and go toe to toe with Judas. Judas is a true non-apologetic, dark anti-hero. They are well developed characters and their chemistry is bar none. The dramatic suspense, mystery and intrigue has me hooked. I'll admit I'm a little nervous but mostly excited to see how this plays out. Waiting with baited breath for the conclusion of this riveting trilogy!<br /><br />I received an ARC and I am leaving a review voluntarily. Opinions are my own.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20
"Makes life easy and Work great: We decided to automate our home with several WiFi switches. These were great. My son leaves the kitchen lights on. It is so nice to now tell Google to turn off kitchen lights, and they are off, or as you are walking to the room you can ask for them to turn on, and boom, they are on. I added a switch to our bathroom lights, again  our son who neglects to turn them off, and our outside lights. I can now turn on the outside lights by voice... Don't have to get out of my chair. Also when I am at work, I can turn off all the lights in the house with the click of one button on my phone. Now my house is son proof....",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"So Many Uses: My main reason for buying this mat was to put under a large Lexan container that I use for sous vide cooking. The size is right, but it is a little too thin and doesn‚Äôt provide structural support for the weight it would need to hold. No worries though, because of how thin and soft it is, it worked perfectly to set my fruit and vegetables on ‚Äì especially the softer vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers. It does a great job for that purpose ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt have found anything better.<br /><br />Aside from the mat, I put the soap holder beneath the spout of the liquid hand soap dispenser in my kitchen, which is always a mess, and it is doing a good job of keeping my counter clean.<br />The super-soft cleaning brush is great for cleaning soft vegetables like mushrooms, berries, and tomatoes.<br /><br />Overall, I am getting a lot of use out of this set and I am so glad I got it.",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Great sound, but has problems: I've had this for almost two months.<br /><br />Pros<br />I love the sound.  The base is theater-level.  The surround sound is awesome.  It makes me want to buy a TV that matches.<br /><br />However, there are some problems.<br /><br />Cons<br />1) It heats up.  With all HTMIs unplugged, and ""shut off"", it gets almost hot underneath and stays that hot.  During or after a movie, the underside by the controls is too hot to touch.  If my laptop got that hot, I would worry about it shutting down.  To mitigate this, I got a laptop cooling fan to place underneath it, and blocks to place at both end to keep it off the shelf, and that did the trick. Now at the end of the movie, it's nice and cool.  (But it does look ridiculous.  Also I have to add the blocks and plug in the laptop fan every time I use it, in order not to worry.)<br /><br />2) It makes a buzzing sound on the remote speakers when not in use. When I plug in the HDMI from my Roku Ultra, the satellite speakers start making a high-pitched buzzing sound that can be heard from across a the room.  Because I unplug the whole system between uses (see heating problem above), that's not a problem, but otherwise, it could be annoying.<br /><br />Other thoughts<br />I wrote JLB tech support about these issues and they immediately offered to replace the whole setup, which they did. The replacement did exactly the same thing, so I assumed this must be par for the course.",3.0,Electronics,0,12

The pieces come with numbers at each connection point to show you what piece goes where and what order to put them together in. IKEA could really learn a thing or 2 from Zinus! Not that the sturdiness even remotely compares.<br />I was able to assemble this myself in under 30 minutes. I also really love how the slats Velcro on to the frame.

"Found families for the win: I love Gail Carriger and would read anything she wrote, but the Custard Protocol series has been my favorite. The family that the characters have created for themselves gives me all the feels. Honestly, this is something Gail does really well in all her books. Her characters find love and acceptance and a place to belong that feels authentic, even when they're floating around the world on a dirigible or living on a space station.<br /><br />This book addresses a bunch of connections that were hinted at in previous books and series, and brings back a few old friends. Finally getting Percy's perspective (along with Spoo's!) confirms what I suspected about him all along. He is fiercely loyal and protective; he just doesn't show it as obviously as the others do. Add some wonder, madcap adventure, and plenty of tea, and you've got a book I couldn't put down.",5.0,Books,1,7

"This series just keeps getting better and better!!: (Reviewer's Note: I would like to thank Ms. Bennett for providing a print review copy in exchange for an hosest review.)<br /><br />This second novel in the series is even more riveting and compelling than the first novel, and the novella which follows it. In fact, I would say that Bennett has surpassed herself in this installment!<br /><br />The saga of Maya the hybrid 'angel' (actually an energy vampire) and her vigilante half-brothers is seriously addictive reading! In ""Landing"", the relationship of the three siblings becomes even more poignant, as the reader learns further details about their family history, and they are thrown into even more danger.<br /><br />Maya is a totally admirable character; she's constantly fighting against the hunger -- that insatiable desire to 'feed' on energy from humans, killing them in the process. She manages to get by through draining small animals, but the hunger for human energy is always present, tormenting her. In spite of her situation, she's courageous, funny, snarky, and strongly loyal to her brothers, insisting on joining them on all their missions. She's definitely a great heroine!<br /><br />I didn't think it was possible to love Gabe even more than I already did, but, in this novel, his kindness and endless sweetness toward Maya just made me want to hug him! His implicit trust in her is very touching, especially since he knows she could destroy him if she ever lost control. His easygoing, laid-back attitude, in the face of their family tragedy, is absolutely wonderful! Unlike Tarren, Gabe wears his heart on his sleeve. Maya, who can see human auras, can read him much more easily than she can Tarren, who keeps a very tight rein on his emotions.<br /><br />As for Tarren, I have very mixed feelings about him.  It seemed that he was beginning to trust Maya more in Coping, the novella in this series. However, this is really not the case at all; his attitude toward her remains one of cautious tolerance. He never fully lets her in, so she can only catch glimpses of what he must be feeling. He's even willing to risk her life at one point in the plot, against Gabe's vehement protests. So I found myself alternately disliking him, and then feeling sorry for him. After all, he has suffered at the hands of the heinous villain in these books -- terribly so. Still, his actions toward Maya are really unforgivable. In this novel, the reader finds out just how deeply he has betrayed her, simply because he's in pursuit of revenge.<br /><br />Two new characters are introduced in this installment -- a married couple, Kyle and Jane. They're both 'angels'. Maya meets them one night, after she and her brothers have returned from an unsuccessful mission.<br /><br />These characters are very likable, paradoxically enough. They want to take Maya under their wing, and she almost gives in, just so she can feel totally accepted and loved. However, she realizes that Kyle is trying to rationalize the 'angel' lifestyle by telling her that she should only drain people who really 'deserve' it, like criminals, or people who are already dying. She knows that killing a human being is wrong, no matter how you try to justify it. Her condition as a hybrid -- not completely human, yet, not fully an 'angel' -- helps her to resist  the lure of this evil.<br /><br />The action really ratchets up in this novel, as the siblings finally confront the villain -- Grand. In the process, the reader encounters his very sick, disgusting, views toward the humans who have not been 'enhanced'. This is a villain you love to hate; the  thoughts of this most nefarious 'angel' mirror those of Hitler and his Nazis in their contempt for 'inferior people'. Indeed, this warped philosophy is also behind the eugenics movement. Bennett is thus implicitly criticizing it, and I admire her for doing so.<br /><br />This novel, like the previous books in this series, has very profound philosophical implications underlying its action-filled plot. It's also a great example of masterful, suspenseful writing. Furthermore, it's peopled by very vivid, fully fleshed-out characters whose struggles and emotions we the readers come to feel and understand as if we were also going through the same things.<br /><br />Powerfully intense, stunningly compelling, this is a novel that will not let readers go until the very last page is turned! Bennett fully immerses the reader in her terrifying, totally believable world, and she does so with remarkable ease.<br /><br />These characters will remain completely unforgettable to me, even after I've finished reading the last novel in the series, ""Rising"", which I am planning to purchase just as soon as I possibly can! In all honesty, I simply can't praise these books enough, in spite of their very dark themes, and the bleakness of this future, dystopian world. Still, hope remains ever present, and evil will not get the upper hand. In the final analysis, this is what's truly important. Kudos to J. Bennett for her imaginative portrayal of the darkness, as well as the light, within the human soul!",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Great standalone: This is my first novel I have read by Sarah Cradit and I highly enjoyed it. First, if you're looking for a Fantasy standalone that has marriage of convenience, magic, betrayal, twists, spicy romance, and stunning world building look no further! My favorite part about this standalone was Desi who has some major issues and secrets that always backfires on him. He isn't perfect but his flaws were so real and relatable. It was nice reading about a male character that has insecurities and doubts.<br /><br />Can we also talk about how beautiful the artwork is on the cover?!? WOW!<br /><br />Wonderful job Sarah and looking forward to reading more of your books! Thank you for the ARC!",4.0,Books,1,7

Terrible: I was very sad about this purchase but at least it was really cheap. I took a gamble on purchasing a hat for my dog without being able to try it on her. It does not matter whether you measure your dog- this hat was NOT made for canine anatomy. The ear holes and head do not align. If you can get the ears in the holes the hat lifts up in a strange way and does not cover the dog's eyes in any way. I'd give zero stars if I could.

"Pantheon of fun: So excited about this new world of old gods and a dystopian Earth. It's a story where gods have retired to a world far away and humans no longer have the ability to believe in a higher power after they found themselves enslaved by the machines they created to help them. One human dates to defy the Entity that enslaved the humans and sets off across space, crying out to the old gods to hear her pleas for help - one god hearts her prayer and offers her refuge but with it will come great change to world that had known peace for thousands of years.<br />Helios fashioned himself as the king of the retired and old gods. Those who were driven away by humanity when there were no believers left. This little planet had no one on it but Ragnar and the two of them slowly started saving fellow castaway gods over the millennium, but he is restless now missing something. Could he miss humanity and their lusts they insight? Whatever it is her is not giving up this human female?<br />Ragnar knows this female is nothing but trouble. She is a liar and up to no good. He can feel it in his bones. As soon as he felt the oceans boil on her arrival, he knew the change she would bring would be chaotic and possible Earth-shattering. She will punish her and dominate her for being a human even he can't stop what is happening between them. The path that the Fates have set these three on will change not only this world but possible Earth, too.

"Great coverage, setting options and clean bright light.: Bright and dependable. We were in desperate need of a light bright enough to cover the area where we grill and this was the perfect choice. We have our grills located in a set in corner off our garage that has proved to be hard to light well enough to cook by. I had installed two 16 led Solar lights but they just weren't doing what we needed so I bought this 48 led Solar light and it's as  bright as I had hoped and very dependable. I've had this out for over a week we've had a few overcast days but that hasn't limited what this light has been capable of it's been just as bright on the nights after overcast days as it has been with days of full sun. The are 4 setting options on the light ranging from short bright intervals, motion detection combinations and full on and each setting has worked exactly as described the solar panel is the full size of the exposed top of the light and is a flat surface making it easy to install this almost anywhere. Once I had this light installed and set to the option I wanted I was able to move the two other lights quite a ways down the walkway the corner is lit very nicely with  enough coverage to support the lights I moved farther away. I haven't found anything I don't like about this light it performs better than I had expected it's very easy to install with a nice appearance and is maintenance free.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

So far it is holding up better than the Striker or Autospout bottles, however the drinking spout is a separate piece and frequently comes unscrewed. The drinking spout is a dishwasher-safe plastic part that screws onto the bottle, and which the lid screws into. Unfortunately when my child unscrews the lid to take a drink, she often unscrews the drinking spout as well. It seems that now matter how tightly I put it together in the morning, when she comes home from school the spout is attached to the lid and not to the bottle.  Also note, that the bottle is not dishwasher safe.<br /><br />Overall it's a nice bottle and has lasted longer than our plastic Contigo bottles, the spout and washing instructions are the only drawback so far.",3.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,0,28
"Drove to the beach with it filled with beach crap, umbrellas: using with my 2015 Nissan Pathfinder with:  StowAway Hitch Tightener, Master Lock 2866DATSC Swivel Head Receiver Lock, Chrome, ROLA 59516 LED Light Kit for ROLA Railed Cargo Carrier, Reese Towpower 74607 7-Way to 4-Way Flat Blade Wiring Adapter.<br /><br />Drove to the beach with it filled with beach crap, umbrellas, strollers, chairs, etc.  Was about 250 miles round trip.

"handgaurd aluminum structure is insufficient and the mount is poor.: product is nice but mount is poor. Mounted to tapered bars of my KTM 500 EXC it just won't stay in place following a crash which can be a problem on the throttle side. Following a dump, I've had it force the throttle open, lock it in position and forced to do field repair. Nearly impossible to prevent I've tweaked the setup every possible way and it just won't stay in place. I have to carry tools ALWAYS when off-road to repair it. The problem is the inboard mount is right on the tapered part of the bar and so cannot get good grip. Also the aluminum is a bit soft and bends too easily - which of course allowed me to bend it back using rocks as hammers.

"Higher Volume of Flame: Most of the propane torches available for plumbing and home use are &#34;pencil flame&#34; types - Which means the flame is less than a half inch in diameter. This is fine for most home plumbing repairs and soldering. However, for bending glass tubes (especially Pyrex glass) you need a bigger flame to heat the section you are going to bend.<br /><br />This torch has a larger diameter flame, about 3/4 of an inch in diameter. While the flame itself from this torch is not hotter than the pencil flame type torches - It puts out a bigger flame and more net heat. This comes in handy if you have somewhat larger item to heat or solder. While a quarter of an inch larger diameter may not sound that much bigger - the cross section area is a bit more than twice as much as the pencil torch flame.<br /><br />The torch is MADE IN THE USA and I am pleased with he quality and cost. The torch does not have it's own built-in piezo lighter - but you can buy a grill type lighter or a sparker for about $3. Torches with built-in piezo lighters cost 2 to 3 times as much!",4.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"More time fishing, less time tying: Trimmed them to fit my Costas. Holding them on the outside of the glasses and trimming around the frame seemed to work well. A lot less aggravating then having to swap back and forth with reading glasses to tie on hooks, lures. Not as noticeable from the outside as most I've seen. Also doesn't seem to be as distracting while wearing them as sunglasses I've tried that come with the magnifiers built in. Will update if my opinion changes with use. I use 2.0 reading glasses usually, went to 2.5's with these as hook tying is generally done closer to my face and fishing line is harder to focus on than type. Can also check my phone without swapping to reading glasses. Will probably swap if browsing though.",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

Awesome Headphones!: I bought these headphones when they were $52.95 and now that I see they are even cheaper I am considering a second pair!

"In my case, twisted the gate frame: I needed to lift a fairly rigid gate.  I started by installing the bar without the central holding strap.  The result was a greatly-distorted gate (twisted out of plane).  This is because the brace is not on the center of gravity of the gate, but attached to one side.<br /><br />Then I released the tension, and installed the central strap.  This time the distortion was less, but still noticeable.  I have left the gate brace in place, even though I still need to physically lift the gate a bit to engage the latch.",3.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,0,30

"For what it is, this is a great little item.: I received the chance to review this item.  It is a pretty nifty little speaker.<br /><br />1. What's in the box?:  You receive the speaker in a box with some instructions.<br /><br />2.  Aesthetic?:  I received the black version of the speaker.  This is essentially a small sized - try about the size of a golfball - speaker with a strap.  It looks nice, but it is so small as to be almost non-existent.<br /><br />3.  Use?:  The first step beyond placing the strap on the speaker, is to turn on the speaker.  This is done by hitting the middle button.  In this way, the speaker becomes discoverable to the phone, tablet or other bluetooth device.  Once the speaker is discovered by the other device, it is ready to go.  Also, this is a speaker that can apparently get wet, but shouldn't be dunked into the water.  The micro USB is slipped into the speaker and is covered by a rubber cover.  Again,  this can be used in a wet environment, but I wouldn't put it on my summer plastic floatie.<br /><br />Sound?:  Frankly, though the physics of the speaker make sense, the small size of this unit really make the sound that comes out pretty impressive.  Is this the beast sounding speaker?  No.  But, for the size, the quality and the depth of the sound is really impressive.  There is no overamped bass, but this is a pretty good balanced sound.  This speaker is sufficient to fill a small room or a outdoor area that is close to the speaker.  The top volume is not blaring, but present and loud enough.  With the strap, you can put this on a backpack or a bike for putting out sound in an easy way. As is typical, bluetooth provided consistent sound from y device to the speaker without any issues.<br /><br />Overall?:  I was quite surprised at the overall power of this speaker.  The sound is good enough, especially at this pricepoint.  If I was to lose the speaker or dunk it, this would not be a despondent time.  The sound is quite good and clear.  However, I wouldn't buy this expecting room filling sound.  I would expect that this SMALL unit will provide easy sound in a small package for places where size and weight matters.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

And this is America- so it's all about what's on the outside.: It's October and I was on the market for a new cell phone case for my 'new' phone. I loved the fact that my phone was gold so I wanted a case to reflect this.<br /><br />This pink color is super smooth for summer and spring- ideally I would have wanted this coral to be a beautiful burgundy like they sell in the Note 7 size. But not all of us are a Kardashian so we don't always get what we want right?<br /><br />I enjoy that this case is slim compared to other cases. Haven't gone and dropped my phone to test to see how great it works. (I have a 2 year old so give it another 2 months and she will have tested the strength). I thought the back with the grips would be ideal- and they are. Kind of. Things seem to get trapped in there? Mainly dirt? I work a cushy office job and still sing the ABCs twice when I was my hands so it's not that I'm a dirty person but there are distinct marks from fingers on this thing.<br /><br />But it's still pretty.

I use this watch as a weight loss/management tool, and it is great to track your steps, resting heart rate, etc.<br /> I did some research and found that this watch is pretty accurate for calorie count, with one caveat: it has to stand alone. If you link it to My Fitness Pal (MFP) it way overinflates your available calories and here is why. The watch starts with a very low initial calorie count, and counts upward based on your steps and activity level. MFP starts with a base level of calories for an entire day based on your activity level, and you can add additional calories to your day by reporting workouts. Garmin reports these step calories as activity calorie adjustment, which is where the over-inflation comes in. I am posting pictures of relevant data... I have tried the link for negative calorie adjustment on MFP and it did not solve the problem. The only real way to resolve this issue is to disconnect Garmin Connect from MFP and manually report each exercise on MFP, or  just delete the additional calorie adjustments in MFP.<br />Hope this helps...",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Great tablet: I'm typing this review on the A500 now. I was deciding between an Ipad2 (and had actually purchased one), an Asus Transformer, and the A500. I became frustrated with the limitations of the Ipad 2, and once it became clear that the Asus Tranformer wouldn't have adequate stock for weeks, I decided to give the A500 a try. No regrets, and I ended up returning the Ipad2.<br /><br />Why this is better than an I pad 2 -<br />- Micro SD card slot gives this all the memory you practically need with just a 16 gb model. Cards are cheap - you can get a 32 gb card for $50. No card slot on the I pad 2.<br />- USB port makes file transferring easy. You can plug in external flash drives or a USB keyboard. Yes, it has a USB host port so it can externally power or charge devices through the port. No USB on the I pad 2 without buying a $30 adapter.<br />-HDMI port - easy projection to your HDTV. The A500 screen has about the same aspect ratio as most HDTVs, so you will be able to take full advantage of the area on your HDTV. With the Ipad2, you need a separate $39 adapter for this, plus the IPad 2 screen is a different aspect ratio than most HDTVs.<br />-Android Honeycomb is way better than Apple iOS. It's much more customizable and supports true multitasking. Yes, iOS has a simpler, dumber interface that your grandma can use, but for me it is too simple and limited. Plus, with Honeycomb you are not chained to using ITunes to manage your content. You can just plug it into the USB port of your PC and manage files like you would any external USB drive.<br />-If you use Google applications like Gmail, Picasa, Docs, Maps, Youtube, etc., the integration is excellent. You log in with your Gmail account and all your Google data is synched to the device within minutes.<br /><br />Don't believe the reviews about lack on apps for Honeycomb or frequent crashes. I have had almost no issues in a week of use. Most of the apps for Android smartphones I tried work fine and there are over 65,000 of them now. The Android market is better than the Apple market because there are a lot more free apps.<br /><br />Because of the USB port this is a better value than the Transformer too, which doesn't have USB port without the separate docking station.<br /><br />This is a fast, powerful tablet, great screen, long battery life (I'm getting two days with normal use). A good value.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE 10/20/11: Had the A500 tablet for 6 months. Netflix works on it now, and it got an update that enabled Skype and Google Video Chat as well. The OS updates to Android 3.1 and 3.2 made it run faster and smoother. However, after the Android 3.1 update the microphone sound got pretty muffled to the point that video chatting or using it as a camcorder became pretty poor. I would have to speak rather loudly or directly into the speaker for it to get picked up. I checked around online and this seems to be a problem that many people have experienced due to the OS update on their A500 tablets. There were rumors that the Android 3.2 update would fix the problem, but this didn't happen. I downgraded from 5 stars to 4 stars because of this.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the Android Honeycomb tablet experience and not regretting returning the IPad, but I wanted something that would work flawlessly for video chatting. So I purchased an Asus Transformer, updated it to Android 3.2, and tried out the microphone, and it worked fine. So I ended up selling my A500 and am using the Transformer now instead. Had the microphone worked flawlessly, the A500 is still the better tablet in my mind than the Transformer due to the full-sized USB port and the metal construction, but they are pretty close. If you don't plan to use the microphone I think the A500 is still the better deal. But Asus seems to do a better job of pushing out OS updates.<br /><br />I recommend you'all take a serious look at the Honeycomb tablets. There are many available now, all pretty close in specs, for much better prices than IPads and they are more versatile. With the upcoming launch of Android 4.0, the operating systems for smartphones and tablets will be unified, which will make many more apps useable on the tablets. Just like Android smartphones eventually blew away the IPhone in market share, Android tablets will do the same to IPads someday, I am confident.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

I don't normally write reviews for anything but seeing how I am out nearly $500 for just these two cameras, I feel obligated to let anyone looking into purchasing these items know that they will not last. It may be worth mentioning that I also purchased the doorbell camera from Arlo and it has been even less time than the floodlights and there is sun damage on it to where the plastic is turning orange. I am extremely disappointed in my investment in Arlo for home security because I am out nearly $1000 for cameras and monthly payments and only getting paper weights in return.

"Almost unreadable: This series is just plain bad, I read the second one based on all the positive reviews...I thought 'Who knows...maybe the writer gets better'. I can now only assume that the positive reviewers read a different series to me. I resent having paid money based on those reviews and so I write this to counter them. I think the writer is genuinely passionate about their writing but no way would a publishing house let this near their front desk.<br /><br />A few points:<br /><br />a) The editing is terrible, someone ran an auto correct spell checker through it so it beats some other awful books I've read on kindle but it's still really bad. Inconsistent descriptions, repetitious use of words, misuse of words and so on.<br />b) The 'hero' is a complete Mary Sue. She never runs into any difficulty that slows her down for half a second. Everybody loves her despite her being a rather unpleasant 'my way or the highway' harridan. (Spoiler alert...her highway is usually to just kill them, warranted or not). She develops powers and resources that clearly put her on top of the heap...kind of like Superman but without the kryptonite. In short, she doesn't have a struggle and so she is plain boring<br />c) Characters keep being introduced to us as if they were super cool and suave dudes but they just aren't. One supposed cross between James Bond and a werewolf hacker starts every second sentence with a the same set of swearwords that I can't write here.<br />d) The story sacrifices coherency so we can jump around with godlike omniscience and look through the eyes of various characters seemingly just because the author likes the characters, but without advancing the plot<br />e) The so called military thing that the reviews talk about....It's like playing Call of Duty in god mode.

"Bulb gets patchy in places: This projector is great for sporadic use. If one wants to watch an episode of a television show, or something as equally short, I‚Äôd wager the projector would serve that purpose. For professional level media consumption, however, I wish I‚Äôd paid more for a higher quality projector.<br /><br />The quality is nice; it scales to 1080, but it‚Äôs not a true 1080.<br /><br />The built-in speaker provides ample sound.

"FOR OUTDOOR USE ONLY!!: This is a TON of fun when using outside on pavement. My kids actually were chasing it down our dead end street and having a great time. I'm not sure if the top speed really is what the seller claims, but its plenty fast (can keep up and/or outrun a kid running) and very easy for anyone  to control.<br />Something to note, however, that is only in fine print on the description above: This is recommended for outdoor use only! I was going to originally give this a worse rating since the car would just slip around on my hardwood floors. The motor spins the tiny wheels so fast, it seems to only get enough friction to move in a straight line on carpets or pavement. Hardwood and laminate or other smooth flooring types are simply too slippery, and since it is a rear-wheel drive system, it starts to spin out of control.<br />Now that I see it is recommended for outdoor use, I understand and admit that it is worth 5 stars for that. My kids had a blast with it. A car this fast doesn't really belong indoors anyway (it will inevitably collide with a wall or two if you tried!).",5.0,Unknown,1,32

Carport: We bought one of these over 2 years ago and the canvas roof just started leaking. We just bought another complete kit and traded out the roof canvas(Polypropylene).  I think it started leaking because we have a side kit on it and we had a boxelder bug infestation this summer. We sprayed a lot of bug killer on and around the roof and fogged it a couple of times.  That may have been a little too much for the roof.  We put 6x6's around the perimeter and screw the legs down to them. That keeps it on the ground when it is windy.  We also screw the bottom of the sides to the 6x6's.  If you buy the side kit for it you have a very inexspensive shelter.  Price vs. Product you can't go wrong.,5.0,Unknown,1,32

"VERY light use only!: I've had this shredder for about 2 years. My only complaint over the past two years was that the stated maximum of 6 sheets is a total lie.

I'm only feeding it 1 or 2 at a time but it still seems to overheat from the work and completely quits working after about 20 pages. After leaving it alone for 10 or 15 minutes it is willing to shred another small number of pages before stopping again.

"compelling arguments: Mr. Dershowitz has a secular theory of how our ideas of human rights evolved over time.  He rejects the idea that ""rights"" can be derived from natural law, divine law, logic, or even human jurisprudence.  He posits that ""human rights"" come from experience with ""human wrongs,"" those events that we all agree have gone very badly.  In other words, human rights evolved as sort of a trial-and-error golden rule:  stop doing unto others what we really wouldn't want to be done unto us.  He calls this approach ""working from the bottom up, from a dystopian view of our experiences with injustice...""<br /><br />The first half of the book deals primarily with where our rights come from.  (from experience, he argues)  The second half of the book switches gears to contemporary issues and controversies.  Here he offers no answers, but rather argues that the answers will change depending on how the argument is framed.  There are points at which the author comes across as arrogant, but hey, he's a lawyer.  The arguments are compelling and well-crafted, and most readers will find that they agree with some points and disagree with others.<br /><br />Overall, this book is well-written and at times it is even engaging.  If you have any interest in legal, political, or ethical theory, this book is worth reading.  If you are a Social Darwinist or an Ethicist of any religious stripe, you may be interested in learning about how ""the other guy"" thinks.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Interesting story. Needs a lot of editing.: I saw the cover of this book and was intrigued. The reviews looked very positive so I downloaded the Kindle version. First the good news. The story is interesting and unique and holds your interest till the end.  The author definitely has a great imagination and has potential. Now the bad news. This book needs an editor. Grammar, structure, dialogue and use of punctuation is terrible. This book is at best, a first draft.  This is what happens when a self published author doesn't have a professional editor and doesn't have sufficient writing skills to properly construct sentences, dialogue and paragraphs.  I could go on and on but there is no need. I am not trying to be mean but if a person holds himself out as an author, he should produce a professional book.  I hope Mr. Hershey takes my criticism to heart. It is not an attack on him, just his work product.  I think Mr. Hershey has some real talent, but he needs to have pride in his work. I would have rated this one star except for the story. It was very enjoyable. With some editing, the book could be a true five star book.  All the glorious five star reviews must be friends who overlook the deficiency in writing.",2.0,Books,0,7

"Great dual monitor stand!: There is a lot of goodness packed into this small(ish) box! I have an older NM North Bayou single monitor arm and needed to upgrade to something new for a dual monitor setup. This was a perfect fit for me and I knew I was getting a reliable product since my last NM North Bayou monitor arm has been lasting me well over 5 years with zero issues.<br /><br />The dual arms are well packed, so well in fact I thought it was missing the top parts for each arm upon opening the box. Luckily they are backed underneath in insert! It was easy to setup and came with a ton of extra screws and mount parts. It is nice that they also include the tools needed for installing two different ways and tighten or losen the tension.<br /><br />The quality of the products is mostly metal, with plastic base topper and plastic cable covers. These cable covers come off by sliding them forward. The bottom ones I like, since they slide easily, the top ones I can see breaking if not careful. They have to flex to detach and anything that flexes is bound to break from the strain. We will see how long that part lasts. The one monitor arm I had screwed the cable cover on, but these are much easier to take off or put on, and hold more cables because of their design.<br /><br />One bonus feature is the USB 3 port at the base. I actually needed this because my primary monitor has a switch and so I can plug my keyboard through the base. Only thing to note is the USB cable does not come off, so if you don't need it you'll have a useless port and a blue cable hanging off the back.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid dual monitor arm setup. It fits my two 27 inch monitors perfectly and gives me the flexibility of use I desired. I am very happy with them.",5.0,Electronics,1,12
"THESE ARE NOT ANYTHING LIKE YOU'RE HOPING FOR IF YOU WANT THE TRUE RED COLOR AS IT SHOULD BE!: I purchased these as a modification to the truck that I purchased and I purchased them for two reasons, one of which I have stated already. The other reason was because it stated that they were NOT STICKERS!!! Well, folks, let me just say...I don't know what else you would call them. They are exactly that in my opinion. The letters are barely raised for one, second, they're are maybe the equivalent to the cheap magnets sheets some people get to leave a note or reminder on the frig. Third, the color that is on the letter is more to the maroon color of the truck line of paints. Fourth, the part that is colored, ladies and gentlemen, is basically vinyl adhered to magnet sheets with adhesive on the back to stick them to you vehicle. Nope, no thank you, not today! I am out the funds and was gifted the headache of the fiasco, but maybe, just maybe I can save someone else from and enhanced, over exaggerated description for crap!

"The photos are fantastic, but beware some of the procedures.: I purchased his book, for several reasons.  I have suffered from lower lumbar back pain for 40 years.  Forty years ago, the Veterans Administration Hospital strongly recommended surgery. And meanwhile provided grocery bags of pain killers.<br /><br />But I also lived and worked in an African village for two years. I knew Esther was on the right track. The functional posture and strength of both men and woman in the tribe in which I lived, was  awesome. Esther's photographs beautifully capture the functional strength and poise that I witnessed many years ago.<br /><br />I bought this book with great hopes. Sadly, some of the ideas in this book only injured my back further.<br /><br />But I can also say the same for the dozens of &#34;back books&#34; and seminars which I have read or attended over forty years. Whether the subject is Tai Chi, Yoga, or Pilates, I always find that some exercises seem to help, but there are unhappily always a few exercises that do further injury. And there is the rub.<br /><br />I am also amazed that Esther does not show the ancient &#34;village squat.&#34; This is a glaring omission. A westerner can not live, or travel, in the 3rd world and not observe the ease and frequency with which villagers - young and old - can assume the village squat.<br />Generally, Westerners just can't seem to squat like this for any length of time.  I am mystified that this functional and popular position is not captured in her photographs.<br /><br />I would love to see Esther take her beautiful - but beginning research - a step further.<br /><br />Thankfully, I eventually found right here - at Amazon - some back books and DVD's which have given me relief from back pain for the first time in 40 years  - as well as a new found ability to run and ice skate again.<br /><br />Admittedly, my search was a long journey, but I found the best self help yet in the books and DVD's of Peter Egoscue.  Book by book, I became so impressed with the results, that I eventually bought every book and DVD Peter has written or produced.<br /><br />My back problems are largely confined to the lower lumbar area, due to injuries sustained in Vietnam in 1970.<br /><br />Ironically, Peter Egoscue is also a Vietnam veteran who sustained injuries while on duty. Peter embarked on his own search to heal himself.<br /><br />What a marvelous, simple and sound approach he has pioneered.  Not one of Peter egoscue's procedures has ever caused my back further injury or pain!<br /><br />In response to the one negative comment I received, may I affirm and clarify that my back injuries are serious - due to substantial injuries sustained in Vietnam. I do recognize that many other people will be well served by Esther's exercises.<br /><br />But, I also wish to extend a hopeful hand to those whose injuries are severe, life long, and who so far may have found only partial or intermittent help with the many modalities of back treatment that have developed over the past 40 years.<br /><br />In addition, to the books and DVD's I recommended above, I now wish to one more book that I earlier withheld - due to its price. &#34;Rehabilitation of The Spine: A Practitioner's Manual&#34; by Craig Liebsenson. Available here on Amazon.<br /><br />Yes, the price is edgy! But this book is a must have for anyone who experiences chronic and severe back difficulties. A magnificent and clearly articulated review of all of the current treatment modalities available in the mainstream as well as the alternative medical fields today. Pay attention to what Dr Vladimir Janda is doing to treat patients in Czechoslovakia.<br /><br />Ok. A couple years later, and I wish to add another writer, especially for those persons with serious injuries - sports related or work related. I discovered the fellow who has co-authored more than 300 clinical published studies on the back and spine.  He is a fountainhead of knowledge for trainers and rehab experts alike. He is quoted by the best of the best trainers regularly. Two of his books -  directed toward the medical professional ---  are available here on Amazon. &#34;Low Back Disorders&#34; and &#34;Ultimate Back Fitness & Performance&#34;  by Stuart McGill, PhD.<br /><br />His research methods are exquisite.  He busts more fitness myths than any writer I have yet read - and he does this with science based data, much of it derived from his own labs. I must caution that he writes to the trainer and rehab audience. But his writing is extremely clear to me, a lay person. Nearly every page in the first half of book, &#34;Low Back Disorders,&#34; is filled with lab evidence as to why so much of what your coach, your drill instructor, your fitness guru, and / or the muscles mags are saying is simply dangerous or wrong.  This half steers you away from incredibly dangerous , but popular routines. That knowledge alone is worth a lot.<br /><br />As you will recognize in all of his books and DVD's, Dr Stuart McGill works with the highest performing world class athletes.<br /><br />He also publishes two DVD's which I have not found here on Amazon.<br /><br />Once again, good luck with your own search for back health.<br /><br />Added, Sep 11, 2016<br />Are you folks  aware that Dr Stuart McGill has finally released a new book.  His first book in his 30+ year career, now intended to help the lay person? Everyday folks.<br /><br />Having read all of Dr McGill's books and watched all of his DVD's -- which are geared toward the professional, I can now say that this new book, &#34;Back Mechanic&#34; is the best written and edited, the best produced and best illustrated of all his books.<br /><br />I presented a copy of this book to an attending Physician at  the local Veteran's Medical Center, Department of Rehabilitative medicine.<br />I told her I might recommend this book to other veterans. But first would like to hear her own opinion. Do you think these ideas will case any harm?<br />Do you think these ideas will help veterans?<br /><br />She got back to me, &#34;I love it! It is so easy to read. So easy for the veteran to understand.  I have received approval from the Department Director to make this book available to all of my veteran patients. We are now seeking the funding from the Education Department.<br /><br />It was released just recently.<br />Available at Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Back-Mechanic-Dr-Stuart-McGill/dp/0973501820<br /><br />Most importantly, for the first time Dr McGill has included a self diagnosis procedure, so that every day persons can hopefully determine the major causes and/or sources of their back pain.<br />The book covers rehabilitation remedies that address each particular diagnosis.<br /><br />I can say that having read all of his prior books and learned so much, I am now learning even more in this beautiful edition. The illustrations are clear and extensive.<br /><br />Once again, Stuart McGill dispels so many sports rehabilitation myths and legends. He lays bare many surprising details that are truly harmful to a healthy back. And describes in detail the way back to real recovery.<br /><br />I am only a bit more than 1/2 way through it.<br />I deliberately set a slow pace. Stopping to try out his techniques and his self diagnosis strategies.<br /><br />We are fortunate to have the wisdom of this man who has spent decades in his research laboratory as well as his rehabilitation facility. He has worked with the world's top elite athletes for all of these decades, as well as everyday folks who are injured.<br /><br />This book may become the classic in its field. The starting place.<br /><br />I will may write a review and post it when I have finished reading the entire book.<br /><br />Good luck.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Not a good movie overall, but a cool ACTION movie.: I dislike the movie overall. It is too much like terminator 2. The graveyard scene, the whole terminator with emotions, and even the car chase is a little like terminator 2. The soundtrack is awful compared to T2, which has the best soundtrack EVER. But the movie does have action. Mabye a little comedy.<br />ACTION thats all that matters in the movie. Everything else is crap, but the action is great. The car chase where the sidewalk and stuff is decimated is pretty cool. There is more action, and some good effects.<br />The problems still. If you are looking for a good movie, forget it. The T-X is terrible. The bad guy in t2 was almost indestructible, but the T-X is killed so easily that she is almost a joke. The whole thought that machines would suddenly switch to a female terminator is stupid.<br />There is the problems I mentioned, but the biggest one is the ending. Well, theres this one part where they try to get into this super secret place but they are not told about the super secret place really. They use this book to find a code which gets them in, yet they were told that the place led them to somewhere else, so how did they get the code for the actual place they went to? I know that sounds really confusing, but when you see the movie mabye you will understand what I mean, not many others did.<br />The ending itself is terrible. Don't expect anything, you have to wait now for T4. WOOOO I cannot wait for that not to happen! No offence, but Arnold is getting way too old for this.

"Customer support is terrible! I even purchased an extended two years warranty: Don't buy any HTC.  Customer support is terrible! I even purchased an extended two years warranty, I was basically kicked around by the warranty company and HTC.  The touch screen started to fail to respond after a few months.  I contact the warranty company, and was told I need to talk to HTC since it is within one year and should be under factory warranty.  Well, it took me three tries (once on the phone, twice on on-line chat support) to figure out yes indeed my phone is under the factory warranty.  And the advice given (eventually I had to do factory reset, erasing all data from the phone) by the service rep was useless.  So I tried again and again online, and their live on-line support simply would not load.  I eventually found their customer support number through google (you won't find the customer support number on htc.com) and told the support guy their supposed online chat service is not working but got no response.  Anyway, instead of swapping a working pone for me, I have to mail my defective phone in, and wait for seven to ten days before I can get it back.  I paid for my warranty but don't get the service.  No phone for two weeks?  Well, screw you!--that's the attitude from the support.  So, be warned: stay from HTC as far away as you can!",2.0,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0,9
"4 Seasons?? Guess it depends on the Region: This is a great sleeping bag for lightweight packs. I use it for Wildland Firefighting in my camping gear bag and selected it for its compact size and low weight as we have to keep our bags under 50 lbs (total).  Every pound counts. I'm confused about the description because it claims to be 6.6 lbs, while the product specs state the package weights 2.18 kg. (4.8 lbs).  Either way, it's not very heavy. When the sun drops and its in the 70 and 80's, it's a bit too warm and serves better as an open-face blanket or a sleeping pad, When it drops down into the 30's and 40's, it's almost not warm enough.

"not what I expected with a hole in the shirt: This is a shirt and shorts set made of matching material.  After a single  washing, the set does not resemble anything worn by the model other than the color.<br /><br />The shirt and shorts‚Äô seams puckered after just one washing.  The image of the shirt on the hanger gives a good indication of how it will drape across your shoulders and chest: horribly.  As you can see on the shirt, the material is so thin that the backer board measurements are clearly showing through.  Below the puckered shirt pocket is an interesting hole.  I have seen worse shirts but usually ones I‚Äôve worn for years.<br /><br />The shorts shape up a little better until you wear them.  They are baggy and the pockets, while very shallow, are positioned too far to the front of the garment and not to the side as one would expect.  The pockets also do not lie flat against the rest of the garment but gape open.  That‚Äôs not the worst of it.<br /><br />The shorts are made of the same material as the shirt.

"Good product in low price: Given this bottle to my mother. she likes it a lot. The quality of the bottle is good and also the look. Other good thing about the bottle is that it definitely helps the coffee to remain hot for hours.<br /><br />Other pro is that small cup is included with the bottle.

"Tricky clasps: These worked perfectly as waterproof carriers for our phones, room keys, cash, etc.  The issue is that although with practice you get used to opening and closing the two clasps, when in the open position they can (and do) fall out completely, leaving you to bend down and pick it up off the floor.  Getting them back in was not something you could do without paying attention to what you were doing, so if they could figure out a way to make sure these don't fall out these would be perfect!  The kids got tired of it eventually and stopped using theirs.  I hung in and kept using it all week, but it was a bit of a commitment.  We did not try to use them underwater.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"Fun but Should Include Instructions: I have mixed feelings about these. We love blind bags in my house so these are definitely the type of thing we enjoy.  I think this would have been more enjoyable if there were unpacking instructions. There's a couple little pieces of paper inside the capsule about how to use the stand, etc. but there's nothing telling you what order to unbox things or where exactly everything is that needs unboxed. Obviously, going in order of 1, 2, 3 makes sense but there are both bags labeled 1, 2, and 3 and parts of the silver box/stand labeled 1, 2, 3. Part 2 of that is actually on the bottom of part 1 so we didn't notice that until we had completely unboxed everything else.  On the first one we did, the bottom part of the box fell off and popped open and kind of ruined the surprise because there was a Tinkerbell sticker in there. There's a scratch off clue and a thumbprint clue which I had no idea what to do with. I realized when looking at the listing again that it's heat activated but I had to rub that on my leg like I was trying to start a fire to get it warm enough to show a bit of shadowed picture and it disappeared a second later. So it's fun to try and figure out what you'll get but it's also sort of a pain. My kids like the figures. I feel like the stands will end up in the trash at some point because they just sort of set on top of each other and don't really have a use unless you plan to display these and not play with them.  I personally would have preferred something more like the Doorables where you get more figures and less filler junk (like the multi piece stand, little cardboard pieces, etc.). It's a fun, albeit confusing experience, but one I probably won't seek out again.",4.0,Toys_and_Games,1,31

"Great Quality - Customize to remove grommets: I agree with other reviewers that these are a very good value.  I had ordered previously from Wayfair and although the price was half what these are, they looked so cheap I had to return.  What I didn't care for about these was the silver grommets.  I think they deserve something better than grommets for hanging which remind me of shower curtains.  I bought a longer length and will cut the end off with the grommets and make a rod pocket.  I'll make the pocket with a flange at the top too so it will have a nice bit of ruffle at the top.  I was happy to see that these curtain panels come with tie backs also - they are a solid cream color that matches the fabric.  I will look into other products this vendor offers.  To buy fabric and make your own panels yourself is much more expensive than just buying panels.",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"Great shutter release for the price: Came in the mail at a reasonable speed (for the slow speed that I paid for). Overall, I really enjoy this product, especially for the price I paid for it. The HUD light up display is really handy when you're shooting in low lighting condition. It didn't come with directions but it took me less than 5 minutes to figure it out. If you're have a basic understanding of time lapse photography or even just photography you'll figure out how to use this product. I really love having 2 adapters for different camera types, but I've used only 1 of them so far for my Canon 10D. I've already taken this with me on 3 night shoots and it's performed very well. It also has a manual shutter release button for when you need the immediacy of releasing it but want a steady/no camera shake shot.<br /><br />My only complaint is that you have to remove the batteries for it to completely turn off, otherwise it'll stay on until it drains the AAA's. There was one instance where it was one of those 5 minute windows in the day when the clouds and sky we're beautiful and I ran to grab my camera and release timer (I was doing slow shutter stuff and I'm super OCD about camera shake). It wasn't until after I had set up the camera that I realized that my shutter release trigger was missing a battery from the last time I had removed it to turn off the product. I'll need to figure out a better workflow for removing/keeping track of my batteries, and it's a small inconvenience (reason for 4 stars). For the price I paid, I'm very happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone shopping on a budget.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

I'm 5'5&#34; and not particularly tall, but I do have a long torso and I found it to be a bit short waisted, but not enough to be bothersome.  I get a lot of compliments on the overall dress and especially the color which is a much deeper green than the picture shows.  The lace is SO soft, it was entirely unexpected.  The fabric does wrinkle easily but a little starch or the underside before ironing seemed to solve the problem.  The top button is difficult to button and I recommend reinforcing with a few stitches after a couple of wears,",4.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"Yea it's remastered, but is it that different?: I always thought that some of these cuts were the Beatles at the top of their game--Strawberry Fields, All You Need is Love, I Am the Walrus.  So I bit and bought the remaster.  I knew I'd listen to this a lot, especially if it were really different.  First of all, I do a lot of listening in my car--good sound system and I enjoy the bubble of sound.  Threw this in and sure it sounded like MMT, but it didn't sound any different from the digitized copy of the vinyl I made a few years ago.  I finally had a few hours to myself, and I decided to try the remastered back to my steady digitized vinyl on my sound system.  My wife was out, the stereo was pumped up to its potential.  Were the two recordings different?  Yes.  The remaster certainly was louder and had definite separation from the vinyl.  Did it make me want to go out and spend a lot of money on my other Beatles recordings?  No.  Excuse me, but I can't make believe that it's like hearing a recording for the first time.  It's not.  We all know every note.  For a bit more of bass tone, or for the voice to be clearly on the right speaker, it just seems like a Magical Mystery Monte Game to replace a lot of recordings.",4.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

beyond the time barrier: i enjoyed watching &#34;beyond the time barrier&#34; very much.  the story is set in 1960 during the beginning and the end of the movie.  robert clarke is a military pilot who is test piloting a military jet that somehow time jumpes to the year 2024.  he sees that people in this future time have mutated and became sterile except for this one young deaf mute woman.  he also meets three people who have also time jumped to this time from the years between the 1970s and 1990s.  he manages to go back to his own time and tells his story of what happened to his military superiors.  military personnel find evidence of these three people.  what happened to his physical body after he arrives back in his own time is shocking.  one other thing i like about this movie is that it doesn't have the vulgar language in it that some movies of today have.,5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"What do two inch center to center drawer pulls and the Yeti have in common?: Who knew that two inch center to center drawer pulls would be so hard to find?  I purchased a used dresser after mine had an unfortunate accident (well it was cheap and 17 years old so I wasn't terribly surprised when one of the legs broke as I was moving it to have some carpet replaced).  My replacement dresser needed some sanding and refinishing on the top (due to some scratches), and it was begging me to replace its old outdated colonial era drawer pulls.  I figured I could pop into my local big box hardware store to buy some replacements.  Little did I know that two inch center to center drawer pulls are almost as elusive as the Yeti, somewhere out there but requiring a major hunt.  What to do with this dilemma? Turn to Amazon of course.  I found these, ordered them and waited patiently for the mailman to deliver them.

Message board-lingering, online rumors and addiction - the way online life feeds our veins like heroin.<br /><br />While it's easy to take it as a commentary that cyberpunk is dead, as we've now become it, I think there's a great deal more depth than even that with its intentive characters, exotic environnments, intrigue - everything you've conventionally found in Gibson's cyberpunk offerings.  If nothing else, the protagonist's ""condition"" alone sets it apart from any modern character in literature.<br /><br />A stellar achievement all-around.  Over the years, I've found it harder and harder for a book or film to really impress me, and this did so in spades.",5.0,Books,1,7

"I LOVE MY TENT!: I'm very impressed with this tent, I had originally bought it from Backcountry Edge for $125 and now the price has dropped on Amazon to $80, total steal!!! I have gone on two camping trips to Acadia, Maine and now on my way to Sacandaga Lake, NY. On my 2nd trip to Acadia we (3 people in the tent) experienced a rain storm, pouring rain, lightning and thunder...the works. There wasn't a drop of rain inside my tent and the 2 vestibules kept our shoes and other items dry.<br /><br />It's sturdy, spacious, very easy to set up (15-20 min) and if you ask me...a pretty good looking tent! The detail of 2 doors is super great, no need to climb over anyone.<br /><br />Helpful Tip: I wasn't crazy about the smooth metal stakes that it came with so I bought additional stakes (Coghlan's ABS Tent Peg) for under $1.00 each and used those for the actual tent. I used the Slumberjack standard stakes for the rainfly/vestibule and ventilation ties.<br /><br />As long as you secure the tent and rainfly properly (including the side-release buckle ties) you should not have any issue with ventilation at all. The tent stays dry through the heat, cold and rain.<br /><br />Sadly, the gear loft and footprint are sold separately but it's also worth the buy!<br /><br />Interesting Find: In my research, before buying this product, I found out that ""Slumberjack is a division of American Recreation Products (ARP), St. Louis, which owns a variety of high-performance outdoor brands, including Kelty¬Æ, Sierra Designs¬Æ and Royal Robbins¬Æ"", Kelty sit/news.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004Y6MJIC Slumberjack Trail Tent Footprint]]",5.0,Unknown,1,32

I waited for a while to test if this product is actually worthy. I love using it!<br />Pros:<br />- Super easy to clean and maintain<br />- You can make so many dishes with this air fryer<br />- With the right temperature, food was cooked perfectly and crispy<br />- Super fun to be able to watch food cooking inside through the glass door<br />- Excellent customer service: I contacted the company to buy another inner rack due to chipping off issue and they sent me another new air fryer!!! So surprised and I greatly appreciate it!<br />- No smell<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Can be a bit loud when it first started but the noise gets lower when cooking<br />- Need higher temperature setting to crisp up food: You have to test use your air fryer with different temperature setting to know the right one for your food. You can‚Äôt just assume all food will cook the same in different air fryer/oven temps. Because I noticed that this air fryer need higher temp (almost use max 400F) to brown/broil/crisp the food faster.<br />- May cook some food unevenly if you add too much in the basket which is reasonable: Also, shake or re distribute your food to cook more evenly.<br /><br />But overall, I love this product.

We're able to spray 1-2 times without issue, but then the bottle stops spraying and we have to push the button multiple times with a lot of force to get another spray of olive oil. We also had to cut the tube that goes into the bottle as it was touching the side and preventing any oil from getting up to the spray nozzle.

"Light, Fresh, Beautiful: I purchased this, based on reviews I read about it, without having the opportunity to smell it first.  I am extremely happy!  This is some DELICIOUS juice!  When I spritz it on, I immediately get a heady dose of white flowers, rose, and tuberose. (I am one of those people who actually LOVE tuberose.) The initial group of flowers last for a while and then a light hint of lily joins the party. So luscious.  My nose never picks up the orange blossom or the bergamot.  It takes quite a while on my skin for the base notes to warm up, and when they do, I'm not getting as heavy of a &#34;dose&#34; of them as I would like.  I smell no sandalwood (which I love) and only a faint hint of musk and vanilla.  The lack of a richer development of the base notes is the one disappointment I have about this whole blend.  Usually on my skin the base notes are what really have the staying power.  Sadly, I don't find this perfume lasting very long on my skin at all and I really wish it would.  It is such a truly beautiful scent I would love more time to enjoy it before it fades away.  Otherwise, in my opinion, this just couldn't be better. Highly recommended - especially if you actually like tuberose like me!",5.0,Beauty_and_Personal_Care,1,6

"Not a high quality item, but it looks nice at night or from afar.: Lets just call it like it is to begin with.  This is some cheap plastic, a few wires sticking out, some LED lights on the end of the wires, and then all wrapped in thin birch bark looking tape.  I want to be forthright about this being an obviously inexpensive and cheap item.  In a way, it looks like something someone made at home as a DIY project.<br /><br />With that all said, if you're just looking for something that looks nice at night, illuminates a small area with some ambient light, or adds some decor to your winter theme, it's not a bad little tree.  When you get it, it will come folded and then you'll need to straighten out the branches how you see fit.  This is a little time consuming but also lets you set it up how you like which is kind of nice.  You'll also need to connect one wire from the tree to the base.  Make sure to then push the wire up into the trunk of the tree before screwing in the tree to the base.<br /><br />It comes with just the tree, a base/stand, and a short cord in a box.  It can run on either 3 batteries or plugged in to a USB outlet with the cord.  The timer setting is a nice feature.<br /><br />If the tape was wrapped a little nicer or if it just felt a little more substantial and less ""cheap"" I'd give it another star.  As it is, I think 3 stars is fair to generous.",3.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,0,30

However, in the winter, these don't work, as I frequently run in the dark. This beanie works to still wirelessly provide sound without blocking all ambient noise, while, keeping my head warm. The reason I only gave 4 stars is that it is a little TOO warm when running with temps in the 20's. Maybe a BT headband or thinner material would be better. However, if you are not active when outside, like waiting at a bus stop, then this would probably be the ticket.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Quality has changed: I got one of these huts over 2 years ago and it's just now getting to the point where it needs to be replaced so I was expecting another high quality product. For one, the side walls are now unfinished wood, which is fine and honestly probably safer for guinea pigs to chew. But I ordered one of the ones with the fixed top, like I had before, and it was pretty dirty on the top and it had a large area on the side where glue had dripped all the way from the roof down to the bottom and dried. That is definitely not safe for the guinea pigs if they were to chew that area. I assumed it was a fluke so I asked for a replacement but the second one had the exact same problem and actually was an even bigger drip area. Not sure if this is a production issue or a quality control issue or what but it definitely has discouraged me from getting another.",3.0,Pet_Supplies,0,26

"that is very nice. Level one is okay it could be a ...: The size of this lamp is not very big at all, its very small. But the light in the lamp is very powerful, and gives off a very bright light for you. There is a three level brightness, that is very nice. Level one is okay it could be a little brighter, level two gets better, and level three is very right and lights up the room very well. The blue light for the message board is very very bright as well, and when you want to turn it on you have to hold your finger on the button and touch it for a couple seconds, same for when you want to turn it off. The marker color is very blue and bright and I love the color. IT makes it look like your writing on something futuristic or something. The eraser is kind of terrible and only erases a little before the blue on the board takes over the eraser and you cant erase anything anymore. So I would suggest finding a dry erase thing to take the marker off the board or a wet paper towel. The neck of the light is very very flexible and very easy to move so make sure you put in the place that you want it and not to bump it because it will move and knock out of place. Overall I really liked this item other than it is really small.<br /><br />I received this item for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review",4.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"The Queen of Image: Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon redefines imagery.  She laces simple experiences with such sentences of silver lining like in her piece Long Road, ""your toenails painted silver, sprinkling like change on asphalt.""<br /><br />Her collection of poems in Black Swan explores identity.  Van Clief-Stefanon is bold in her examinations, paralleling a coat of black spray paint to her black skin in ""1. Brass Room"".  Her poems are simple yet thoughtful.  One of my favorite poems 11:11 am reads to me like a prayer, ""The first tree to change stopped you again in the bathroom this morning.  Weeks you watched it turn: yellow, then fiery; brown too soon.  Water running through copper pipes heating the house drowned out the sound of the creek below... Don't waste this wish.""<br /><br />Van Clief-Stefanon has mastered the art of juxtaposition between gripping imagery into undressed, real questions of identity.  Her transitions are subtle enough to preserve the softness she so freely through her words, yet her deep poem parallels create beautiful contrasts in which she sews questions of identity.<br /><br />Van Clief-Stefanon's words are chilling and truthful.  In Groove, she talks of her fear of dirty dancing with men, ""I pressed my palms against my partners back, pulled myself into his chest, close enough to wear my body into scar.""<br /><br />Van Clief-Stefanon even finds truth in the life of a night dancer, exploring the loneliness of living as a faceless individual.<br /><br />Van Clief-Stefanon, through her brave questiong, pieces together the many beauties of life.  And for this Black Swan will continue to be my bookshelf treasure.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Unreliable, not to be trusted: I replaced five thermostats in my house with these units.  Occasionally, the ELV4 thermostats will not actually turn the heat on when they are supposed to, resulting in rooms getting cold.  When this happens, the display on the ELV4 indicates that the heat is on, but the heaters aren't receiving electrical power, so it appears to be a problem with the relay in the thermostat.  Adjusting the temperature down and then back up causes the relay to shut off and back on, which fixes the problem.<br /><br />ALL five of the ELV4 thermostats exhibit this issue.  New batteries make no difference.<br /><br />Luckily, my home has many heating zones so when this happens enough heat leaks from room to room and I haven't had any rooms go below freezing.<br /><br />However, if these ELV4 thermostats had been installed at a vacation cabin or shore house, the pipes surely would have frozen and burst.

To help him clear his sinuses, Snotty Scotty comes equipped with a very clever hand with two very long, flexible fingers you can use to grasp and pull the boogery masses from his nose.<br /><br />Snotty Scotty's nose is also squishy, so when you see the boogers flowing, you can give him an assist and squeeze his big, pink nose and force the booger masses out.

"Better than you might expect: Dr. Strange from the time of Bewitched. It is a fun movie with TV era graphics.<br />Like the 2014 Benedict Cumberbatch film, we see an awakening Dr. Strange coming into the mystic powers. Sadly, this movie like the more recent one delves into back story without letting the Doctor explore his full potential. As a TV movie that could have doubled as a series pilot this is a fun movie introducing a character. Sadly, the other Marvel hero from TV at the time does not make an appearance. Nicholas Hammond's CBS Spider-Man could have and should have made an appearance in the movie's world. Since this TV movie came before the success of the Incredible Hulk--that ultimately pulled in Daredevil and Thor--the comic book crossover did not occur in Dr. Strange's generation.<br />It is better than you might expect but you have to keep your graphics and pacing expectations set in their proper place.<br />This is much better than the TV quality Captain America movies (that had porn quality dialogue and a revisionist Captain backstory).",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Awakened: Real rating: 3.5/5 stars<br /><br />This book turned out better than I had expected.<br />Awakened started off too quickly.  I was a little confused at first.  Everything just seemed odd in the beginning, especially everything Bran was involved in. I just didn't get it.  Eventually though, when I ""ignored"" the beginning, I got into it; it took a while, but it happened.  I'm very glad I continued on.<br /><br />Lil grew up as a gypsy, living with her grandfather in their RV after her mother and grandmother were in an accident.  Up until a little after her sixteenth birthday, she was a semi-normal human girl.  After she met a boy named Bran, things started to change drastically.  She discovered she had fascinating powers and learned that she was a Guardian, just like her grandfather and her Aunt Janelle.  Will Lil be able to ignore these powers and grow up as a normal girl, or will she accept her destiny fighting demons and honing er powers?<br /><br />There are five other kids her age with powers- the ""Trainees"".  Sykes, Remy, Kim, Izzy, and Bran.  My favorite of all of them, including Lil, is Sykes.  He has a great personality and truthfully I wish she would end up with him instead of her true ""soul mate"".  Kim and even Izzy start off very standoffish but come to their senses towards the end of  the novel.  Remy is in charge of the pack and Bran is the newest who also happens to be half-demon.<br /><br />What really drew me into the book were the characters and the overall plot.  Putting aside the first 15% or so of the book, it had me captivated; laughing and not wanting to put it down.  I would definitely recommend it to patient readers and those who enjoy a good angel read.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Top-notch QUALITY!: Doll was boxed super cute! This doll is made with exceptional quality materials. Purchased several dolls for 6 &7 year old little girls.<br />Purchased one of those ‚Äòreal-like‚Äô or ‚Äòlike-real‚Äô babies. Either way they say it, they‚Äôre really NOT  LIKE REAL, or REAL like anything! To each there own but SERIOUSLY, no way! I fell for the hype and splurged buying two for $80 each. Review: HORRIBLE & returned defective. The slightest pressure on belly created some sort of air suction of the face causing deformed appearance. My 6 & 7 year old girls were traumatized to say the least. üò≥ü•∫  I like to think of things like this as a FUTURE FUNNY Christmas story, key word FUTURE FUNNY cause 100% nothing humorous at the time!<br />The other doll‚Äôs were okay but nothing extra special.

"Fantastic journey as exotic and emotionally rich as any you've ever made.: Set in a world as unfamiliar to most of us as the ‚Äúlong time ago in a galaxy far far away‚Äù of Star Wars, Zarabeth Abbey‚Äôs novel takes her readers on a journey in the pre-industrial northern India of the 1830s, in a central Asia not yet overwhelmed by the Russian and British empires. The book is filled with vivid imagery of Rajput India, as well as what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan. Most importantly, to me at least, the author offers a richly detailed depiction of the complex social and kinship ties that formed a cultural foundation so very different from that in the West.<br /><br />Jefferji (Geoffrey) Tamisen is a young man caught by blood between two worlds. A Hindu devotee of Krishna and Radha, he is the son of an English Christian woman and a Hindu adventurer who disappeared when Jefferji was a small child. Orphaned by the death of his mother, Jefferji was raised in the household of a fictitious Rajput prince, Jaisal Singh, and accorded the honors of nobility in his princely training. What makes Jefferji such a captivating character is that he has chosen to be a temple dancer of the highest caliber, honoring Krishna (Sri Krsna) and his consort Radha with his dances, in which he plays both the male and female roles. While honored in Indian tradition. Jefferji is definitely seen as an anomaly, both by his mixed blood and because of what is clearly a sort of ‚Äútwo-spirit‚Äù role within the practice of his Hindu faith. He is not a warrior, he is a dancer.<br /><br />With the impending death of his princely patron, Jefferji is taken away from the only home he‚Äôs ever known by Captain Fontenoy, a middle-aged English army officer with deep ties to India and an old friend of Jefferji‚Äôs late father. Fontenoy fears British interference in the peaceful succession of Jaisal Singh‚Äôs heir, and decides that Jefferji, with his half-English blood, should be removed from British political temptation. He has another agenda as well. Deep in the High Pamir of Afghanistan lies a buried treasure. As Jefferji‚Äôs adoptive uncle, Fontenoy believes that this adventure will be the making of the teenager‚Äôs fortune, as well as his own.<br /><br />What starts as a commercial-political expedition in fact becomes a spiritual journey for young Tamisen, who feels he has lost Krishna‚Äôs love with his departure from the sheltered world of his childhood. As the adults around him focus on money and power, Jefferji searches for his connection to Krishna, the most Christ-like and loving avatar of Vishnu. From the limited geography he has known all his life, he finds himself lost in wild, unfamiliar mountains, meeting people unlike anyone he has ever met. Chief among these is the mysterious, fair-skinned Circassian war lord Shikander Beg. Geography, politics and greed bring Shikander and Tamisen together, sparking an unexpected spiritual alliance. Shikander, with his dark and bloody reputation, seems an unlikely ally for the noble temple dancer.<br /><br />Of course, there is a bad guy in the mix, another English officer, Broderick Holyoke, assigned to Captain Fontenoy to accompany Tamisen into the High Pamir. Holyoke embodies the archetype of arrogant, racist Englishness; the opposite of Fontenoy‚Äôs transnational empathy. Like Shikander, however, Holyoke has a murky past that is only revealed as their journey unrolls.<br /><br />I was moved by this book‚Äôs beauty and the emotional depth of its characters. For all that Tengarpore, Jaisal Singh‚Äôs principality, is fictional, the whole narrative is filled with an authenticity that is enhanced by the author‚Äôs sense of detail, her careful use of language, and her understanding of both Hinduism and the history of India. Jefferji‚Äôs journey is both an emotional adventure for the reader, and an educational one as well. There are surprising moments of deep spiritual magic, enriched with an exploration of the very idea of love in all its many facets.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Miracle Feeder: Ive only had this feeder for a couple of days and I've already seen a huge improvement. I have two cats and one of them gets extremely anxious about food. No matter how much food I gave him at night, he would always wake me up early in the morning screaming for food and would eat so quickly he'd throw it up, no matter if I gave him a little at a time. Same thing would happen when I came home from work. My other cat would barely get a chance to eat due to my anxious cat eating everything right away. I bought two 5 meal feeders and I put a very small amount into each dish and spaced out the feed times throughout the day and night. Within two days my cat stopped meowing at me for food and theres still food left over in the bowls since my cats know food is coming. The best thing is that my cat hasn't thrown up once since I started using the feeder.<br /><br />The programming is extremely easy and i can change the times whenever i want. If I decide to go away for a weekend I can put more food into the bowls and program them to last the weekend.",5.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26

"Super!: Corvettes have been around for a long time, since 1953.  What the publisher has left out of its long description of this item is that photographers Tom Loeser & Randy Leffingwell have used a unique style of automotive portraiture known as ""light painting.""  The style involves a layering of multiple passes over the stationary vehicles in a dark environment. The reason my pics of the Corvette being photographed don't show up all that well is that the cars, other than the single pass of the light over them required for each layer, are not well lit at all. The result, once the layering is complete, is astonishing!  Leffingwell and loeser have definitely brought something new to the classic car photography table.  Their technique is quite involved and time-consuming, and it's better to read about it than have me try to describe it, however it results in almost surreal and ethereal images of these classic corvettes.<br />I've owned two Corvettes, a coupe and a convertible, and I can't think of another model more deserving of, or that would more benefit from, these photographers' artistic treatment of the cars.<br />Whether you are a photography fan, or a Corvette fan, if you're not already familiar with ""light painting"", I highly recommend this book!",5.0,Books,1,7

"The End of Innocence: I LOVED this book. Set in NorCal at the end of the '60s, it centers on teenager Evie, child of a broken home, whose parents are more focused on their new partners than on her. In desperate need of an anchor in her life, she is seduced into a hippy cult by Suzanne, an older girl whose limited shows of affection are enough to trap Evie like a rabbit in the headlights.<br />The group is headed up by the charismatic Russell, who bears a lot of resemblances to Charles Manson - a failed musician and petty criminal with a dark core of bitterness when reality bites at his idealistic existence.<br />As Evie disappears further and further into the world of Russell and his followers, she finds herself getting involved in situations that take her well beyond her comfort zone, but as long as Suzanne is by her side, she'll follow her anywhere, however dark the path.<br />This is one of the best books I've read in a while.

"Simply Outstanding: I'm happy to give this book 5 stars. Berent tells a rip-snorting story of the air war over Vietnam.<br /><br />The characters are great--Hollywood prodigal Court Bannister, soul sick rich boy Toby Parker, and devout killer Wolf Lochert. Much like W.E.B. Griffin, Berent seems to like priveleged, wealthy characters who don't have to serve, but do anyway and prove to be natural, superb warriors. Not easy for me to relate, but the author did a fine job winning my sympathy.<br /><br />And you will probably learn more relevant information about Vietnam in this one novel than you can from any and every history book that covers US involvement in the conflict.

"an amazon peripheral to sell their media, not a bad thing: kindle fire is an interesting amazon peripheral.. it has better resolution then my ipad... i gave it to my 7 year old grand-twins to play with but they still fight over the ipad... the fire is pretty much useless to me... i assumed because it has ""kindle"" in its name that it was an ebook reader... not really... no more then any other software book ereader for an any-os tablet.... and it has no text to speech.... wifey tries to read magazines but you have to zoom to read... ipad is easier for magazines... so if you are looking for an e-rider device the fire isn't for you.... it will hold lots of books with 6 gig of user memory but 'so what?'.... why would you have a large library on the device if you cant catalog the books.... or add them to collections.... a few of your favorites is better.... i suggest the kindle touch or keyboard kindle as a better alternative for an ereader.... the little kindle is cool but it wont hold my library like the others and i need text to speech for traveling.... i have a model of all the kindles ever made and use them.. the eink nook touch i recently purchased does not meet my needs i un-registered it and gave it away.... i'm loyal to amazon... if the fire had an sd card reader like the nook touch it would be a worth while device, as it stands you will need to make your media decisions BEFORE you leave home,,, you wont be able to pick and choose on the fly unless you are tethered to wi-fi it is also sad about the 'color kindle' not being a robust ereader from the git go because 6 gig would be plenty for books....",3.0,Electronics,0,12

"Book Review: Title: What Are You Bringing to the Table?<br />Author: Sheree<br />Pages: 201<br />Publisher: Self published<br />Date of Publication: February 13, 2013<br />Source: Publisher<br /><br />Author Sheree is from Cleveland, Ohio and speaks on topics related to the process of healing from painful experiences, character & self-esteem building, and cultivating healthy relationships. What Are You Bringing to the Table is her fourth publication; the first three were collections of poetry in which she described as ""narrative therapy.""<br /><br />This work is a Christian inspired self-improvement book primarily aimed at women who are dealing with abuse in past and failed relationships. The intended purpose is to help them heal, to become stronger women, and better potential partners with something worthy to bring to the relationship table.<br /><br />The title suggests that the baggage we bring to the table can destroy a new, potential relationship. The format is one that uses Christian principles as the guiding force in recognizing and correcting our own faults. It uses examples of parables and actual scripture references. The book is a straight-up woman-to-woman conversation, but has relevance for anyone looking for a committed long-term relationship, including men.<br />The main argument the author makes is that when seeking a potential mate we hold them to a high standard while we remain oblivious to our own flaws.<br />This work is targeted to women dealing with loneliness and unsatisfying relationships, but anyone can benefit from the self-improvement insights and suggestions made on how to improve ourselves and how to evaluate a potential mate.<br /><br />The author's style is straightforward and easy to follow. Her use of analogies was especially helpful in explaining the points she was trying to make.<br />The writer takes the anti-feminist view and implies that women of the new millennium are doing themselves a disservice by acting as the aggressors and taking the position of the hunter when initiating relationships, ""our emphasis can be so much on finding the right one that becoming the right one is seemingly an afterthought."" She goes on to say ""get yourself"" together so that when ""the one"" does show up, he too can say he found ""The one!""<br /><br />She offers both psychological and scriptural solutions on how to deal with the pain from past relationships before entering and contaminating new relationships. She also presents techniques on how to build ones character.<br /><br />As a psychiatrist, I especially enjoyed reading her opinions on how to evaluate a potential mate and how to explore his or her character traits. Her views on multiple dating and soliciting opinions from close friends and family differs sharply from those of ""the modern day matchmaker"" Paul Carrick Brunson in his book ""It's complicated (but it doesn't have to be).<br /><br />The author acknowledges that the sexual attitudes commonplace in today's society is at odds with the Fundamentalist Christian values she promotes regarding committed relationships and marriage.<br />I recommend this book for anyone looking for a committed long-term relationship; it will appeal most to those who are open to Christian values.<br /><br />Alvin D.

"A brilliant racer brought down by difficult controls: This game excellently portrays high-adrenaline, high-speed racing.

"Vivitar DVR-310 is a waste of your money!!!: I bought this camera, my first video and digital camera, in the hopes of taking wonderful movies of my honeymoon & my new stepson and I feel cheated.

It's for outdoor use only unless you have florescent lighting in your house.  It's impossible to take a good picture.  You have to try and line it up 5 times to get it right and by that time you've totally drained the 2 AA batteries that it runs on.  I called Vivitar and they wouldn't even hear of refunding me my money despite the fact that I'm so unhappy so if anyone has any idea what I should do with a camera that I don't want, please post it here cause at this point it's a paperweight.

"You get two, so you can afford to practice with the first one: The package arrived during the &#34;dirty season&#34; so trying to apply the screen without getting any contamination under the screen was an exercise in futility, and there is no way you'll get the application perfectly flat if there's even a speck of dust between the tablet and the protective screen. This is not a problem with the screen protector, but keep it in mind and make every effort to work in a dust free location and keep a microfiber cloth handy at all times.<br /><br />The sticky side has enough tackiness to hold onto the screen, but is forgiving enough to pull it up several times as you try to seat it exactly where you want it and work out the air bubbles. You're pretty much going to have to work out the bubbles as you go, and even if you get frustrated by the included paper card for pushing the bubbles out, do not use anything harder as you're likely to ruin the screen protector. Take a deep breath, be calm and appreciate the process, and you'll get there eventually. And because there are two screen protectors in the pack, even if you completely screw up the first time, you should have enough experience from that to apply the second one much more easily. If you already know how to apply these screens, it's hard to beat having your backup on hand for after you've worn out the first one.<br /><br />Not sure about the durability just yet, but seems like it will hold up to normal use and a normal pressure--I don't use a heavy hand for pressure but just adjust the sensitivity to a comfortable mid range.",5.0,Electronics,1,12
"Fair enough: I got this product yesterday, I found that it perfect for night shots over a tripod, I used it with the FZ50, and this camera doesn't have a bulb, and this remote is like the shutter button in your thumb nail without touching the camera over the tripod and without setting the self timer to the 2 seconds position every time to avoid camera vibration, about the lenght of the cord length it is about 3 feet (90 cm), which I think it is good enough.<br />So I recommend it strongly for all FZ50 owners that use it in night shots with low shutter speed over 0.5 seconds over the tripod, and there is no need to pay more to get the RSL1 especially that the FZ50 doesn't have bulb as I said before.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"A Message wrapped within in a thriller: In State of Fear, Michael Crichton writes a thriller about an enviromental terrorist group that tries to create natural disasters in order to increase public belief in global warming.  The story takes us on a wild ride around the world with Peter Evans, a lawyer who gets thrown into the mix, and John Kenner, a government official that works in counterterrorism, as they try to stop the group from accomplishing its goal.  In addition to the usual Crichton thriller, this story is full of true enviromental facts which the author documents throughout the story.  Also, he is trying to show the reader how the media can influence the public and control their opinions.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Kenner constantly tells people that their beliefs in global warming in wrong because they do not check their facts.  This common recurrence is Crichton telling the readers that strongly believing in something that is false is dangerous, even if intentions are good.  Also, through the enviroment group's need to influence public opinion on false statements, he is showing how organizations in our society try to instill fear in to the public in order to control them.  The true message of this book is that when one has the proper knowledge and facts, then they can escape the fear that controls their lives and construct their own belifs.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Well researched  and  written: A balanced handling of the execution of the ""Indian Removal Act"" ..: I was initially a little reluctant to read this book; so many books concerning Native American tribes are bias or one sided either for or against one group or the other. I found this book to be  balanced, and well researched and documented. One of the most complete bibliographies I have seen in a novel, and the accompanying glossary of terms was most useful. This book would be a great resource for anyone looking for a fair handling of the many &#34;Trails&#34; involved in the execution of the &#34;Indian Removal Act&#34; . The target audience is children, but, as an adult I enjoyed and learned from this Book.",5.0,Books,1,7
Everything you need to start an instant grow anywhere garden: I was a bit skeptical of the idea of a state bale garden despite having read a number of interesting news articles.

"start writing not selling: First, lol. The glowing 5 stars all sound like one person, HAHAHA.<br /><br />Anyway. I do not recommend this series, nor this author. Save yourself the angst, and your time. Imagine building to a climax, never to actually finish. Multiply that frustration times 100.<br /><br />Every series is unfinished - so basically it climbs n climbs and THEN it leaves you HIGH N DRY hanging (so basically edging for five years, without ever CLIMAXING).<br /><br />Also, do not recommend the author. She needs to spend more time actually writing, not just selling old books. This series is just another old series that's been republished without that forewarning. Same thing happened with Wren's Song.<br /><br />Just shady practices n shoddy integrity, esp given all the ugly litigation and that whole can of worms.

I kept the column fully retracted for safety.<br /><br />The ONE big issue for me was the ball socket that attaches the iPad bracket to the column.  it was not secure and the iPad kept drooping down and would not stay where I put it. There is no way to tighten the ball socket.  See picture.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Dangerous! Attachment broke after 5,000 miles. Please do not use.: As others have mentioned, the installation is a little finicky, and you have to use a bit of force to make it fit, but it works.<br /><br />I used to roof rails and cross bars to attach a luggage carrier / basket to hold a spare wheel. It held fine... until the roof rail attachment simply snapped. It broke in half (see picture - this happened to the rear left attachment)!<br />Additionally the receivers for the screws attaching the to the rail both sheered off.<br /><br />The total weight of my setup was well below the maximum load. Luckily I noticed that it had broken off before I went on a longer drive. Had the roof rack broken off further while on the road, it could have been life threatening for the drivers behind me.<br /><br />One thing to note is that I do occasionally take my car off road, and as far as I can tell the attachment broke while I was driving at Oceano Dunes through some sand. Off-road driving adds additional stress to the roof rack due to the bumpier ride. *However*, if it broke after just 5,000 miles with the occasional off road section, and significantly below maximum load, it could certainly wear and eventually break during normal driving as well. Maybe it will take longer, but it would probably have happened eventually.<br /><br />I've certainly learned my lesson and will go with a higher quality option next time (unfortunately the Land Rover OEM roof rails seem really overpriced - but I'm now thinking they could be worth it for the peace of mind).<br /><br />The cross bars are ok as far as I can tell. Just please don't use the rails / rail attachments that comes in this set.",1.0,Automotive,0,4

The simple ingredients should speak for themselves (like avocados, cilantro or queso fresco). This book satisfies, but not across the board(er!).",4.0,Books,1,7
"... had this just over a week but I already LOVE it! Several members of the house hold had ...: I've had this just over a week but I already LOVE it! Several members of the house hold had stated they wanted a desktop computer back in the main living area and I've been wanting a Mac. So what I did was order this and a Mac Mini both on here and I connect the Mac via an HDMI cable and I can toggle between using this as a monitor for the Mac and using this as just a straight Chrome. Tip to anyone curious about doing the same, its very easy and all you have to do when both systems are active is tap the &#34;CHROME&#34; button that's flush on the bottom of the monitor.  To be honest, I actually use the Chrome side more often! But on both systems the monitor/screen is beautiful and crisp.<br /><br />I have to come to its defense too: I've seen many complaints about the keyboard. I actually really like the keyboard. And I've tried several in the last week trying to find one that works for the Mac and makes the switching back and forth less of a pain. I will however agree with the slams on the mouse. I promptly replaced with with a Logitech wireless mouse and other than again the pain of switching it when I swap to the Mac, it's been great!<br /><br />Those who are giving this 1 star because it's &#34;slow&#34; or they can't play large RAM games, this is unfair. Buy something appropriate for doing that. Chromebooks/OS based systems are made to be used almost exclusively online. Think of it as if an Android tablet and a standard desktop/notebook had a baby. That's basically what this is. I would guess the average user is doing mostly online activities anyway. For that this is wonderful. Its fast at loading pages, playing YouTube, checking email on it is a breeze. If you need something for those activities DO NOT HESITATE to buy this. I've used many computers and I would say this (along with it's older &#34;sibling&#34; an HP 14 inch Chromebook I bought a few months prior) is my favorite. It turns on and is up and running in seconds. It runs quiet. It also turns off in the same few seconds and switching to a different user, once again, takes only seconds. It's just a fun, fast system!",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"The PERFECT beard brush!: This is literally perfect. People in these reviews who claim it's 'too rough' must be some really sensitive, baby-skinned complainers. This thing is gentle, but effective, and actually feels GOOD on the skin. Like a nice little massage. I live in a pretty dry area where it's common to get flakes of skin from your beard area and have multiple skin disorders (Vitiligo and Seb Derm) and this is AMAZING. I've noticed reduced flaking already as well as a more uniform appearance in my beard. I would definitely recommend using this in conjunction with some oil and beard balm if yours is a bit longer like mine. It def feels like it stimulates the hair follicles and even skin, WITHOUT being abrasive. I have finer hairs, so the bristles go much deeper with ease, so I can only attest to my hair and skin that it IS one of a kind and effective. Do yourself and your beard a favor.

"ending worth a not scintillating beginning: Not to taken with this novel. I'd read a review about how controversial the book was in Egypt and I could see how it makes Egyptians look pretty shallow and greedy (but aren't people everywhere?). But, the writing itself did not really draw me in. The ending was my favorite part and I'm glad I stuck with it until then.<br /><br />The novel follows several individuals who live in the once vibrant and luxurious but now declining and seedy Yacobian building (metaphorically like Egypt herself). Many of the individuals come to bad ends (one is forced into an abortion, another's child dies and the man blames himself because he is homosexual; one is killed while committing a terrorist act). But the main story that gives the novel some hope and potential for redemption is the story of the young, hopeful B who at first starts an affair with the older man but who both eventually fall in love and marry. (this sounds cheesy, but it's not in the novel).<br /><br />I'm sure there are references that would make more sense if I knew more (any?) Egyptian history. The decline of the building begins to occur with the revolution of 1959 (? not sure of the date). While the revolution was apparently supposed to bring freedom, if the book is any indication, it brought greed, bribery, chaos and poverty, much of which is justified in the name of the religion (the big criticism of religion comes when the Sheik is instrumental in forcing one of the women to have an abortion). In Egypt these direct criticisms of Islam may seem particularly powerful, but from the eyes of a Western reader it just seems like same ole same ole.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Loved this story!: Once I started Closer Home, by Kerry Anne King, I couldn't put it down. This was a very well written story, with great characters and and great emotion involved.<br /><br />Lise Redding and Callie Redfern are sisters, but neither have spoken to one another in ten years. Lise is a small town music teacher and Callie is a country singer that has a sixteen-year old daughter, Ariel. While doing a publicity stunt, Callie is killed, and Lise Redding is made guardian of Ariel. Little does Lise know, but life as she knew it is now over. She has inherited everything her sister left behind...her daughter, her money, her mansion, and all of the ups and downs that go hand in hand with fame. She is suddenly front-page news, and is followed everywhere she goes. Still reeling from the death of Callie, and now becoming guardian to a niece she barely knows, she is just completely overwhelmed. Not knowing what to do next, Lise decides to try and find Ariel's father. Old hurt and betrayal is once again revisited during this journey. Lise learns things about her sister, and herself along the way. Lise must learn to forgive if she wants to make this work.<br /><br />This is a journey about family, forgiveness, loyalty and love. Lise is thrown into a world unknown to her, and has to learn how to navigate it and also learn who she can trust, all while taking care of her niece. She quickly finds out being famous isn't as glamorous as it looks, and she is faced with more problems than she could have imagined. I loved the characters, and wanted to see things work out for Lise and Ariel. Overall, I thought this was a great book, and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />I was given an advance digital copy of this book by Lake Union Publishing and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"The colors you think you are getting, won' be there: I like the Modelones brand overall, i have a lot of their gel polishes and the overall quality of the gel is great! That's why I keep going back. Unfortunately, the colors shown on the amazon listing hardly ever match the ones you receive. I recently purchased the ""A1 A Going nude"" which shows a dark brown and aside from that dark brown, none of the colors match the listing. I received 3 pale shades ranging from pale yellow to a pale orange. Didn't receive anything that looked pink or even peachy. Even worse off, the color on the top of the bottle doesn't even match what's IN the bottle. So you'll have to open up every polish to see what it actually looks like before you use it.

"As a Kindle it's Great, as a Tablet it's Medium: I've had 2 other tablets, so I'm fairly well versed with the good and bad points of Tablets. The Kindle Fire is a mixed bag. It's a dynamite Kindle--the books, movies and music portion are terrific.<br /><br />As a tablet...eh. I miss the SWYPE type function of a Galaxy tablet. Not all screens swipe larger and smaller. Amazon's app store is missing a good many native Android Apps (for example, they have the native Twitter app but no native Facebook App).  And of course, it's dependent solely on wi-fi for 'net connection except for books it does have Whispersync. One thing I REALLY miss is Orientation Lock. All tablets should have that and the Fire doesn't, which is annoying as all get out.<br /><br />I'm enjoying it as my bedside entertainment device--my main ""real"" tablet is the one I carry in my purse as it has 3G network capability. But if you have solid access to Wi-Fi, it's not a bad little tablet, at a decent price point. And the graphics really are very very good. It makes streaming Amazon video a piece of cake (since we have Prime, we have access to thousands of free videos--I'm working my way through 4 seasons of The Tudors right now).<br /><br />I def. like it better than the HP Touchpad, but not as well as my Samsung Galaxy Tablet. So much like a computer, what you buy really depends on what you want to do with it. If you just want a multi-media tablet that can run a few apps (email, surf the web, play a few games) then Kindle Fire will serve nicely. The size and weight make it easy to hold in one hand for extended time periods, which is a big bonus.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Elegant Relatable Poetry and Photography: The title Significance: Poems of Small Encounters reminds us of how we feel and react to the events we experience each day from the simplicity of a walk along the ocean shore to the finality of death.<br />Morris contemplates the beauty of nature and art then applies its lessons to the complexities of human beings. What could be simpler than an old picnic table covered with fallen leaves? Yet the memories rush in of family picnics and gardening with her father. A carefree afternoon with friends on the front porch is juxtaposed by the grief of a neighbor. Nature becomes almost human for Morris, those Southern rivers that hold secrets and lilies that bloom within the water. A field of moss is alive with enchanted violets, a beetle, a feather.<br /> She feels and makes us feel compassion for people she encounters in her own life like the Navy veteran whose house burned down and the wrinkled, gray-haired lady in the thrift store. Even those she meets only on canvas like the personification of ‚ÄúSpring‚Äù by Romaine Brooks and Winslow Homer‚Äôs ‚ÄúVeteran‚Äù facing a sea of grain after the war evoke emotion.<br />  The poetry is populated with people and creatures‚Äîladies who weave straw baskets, bees that cling to sweet lavender that sways in the wind, birds, trees, and blossoms. Each small encounter opens another world, magically detailed despite its universality, seen only by the poet, who generously shares it with readers. Then when we read it, we say, oh yes.<br />Andrea Walker",5.0,Books,1,7

"A promising start, but ultimately disappointing: I thought this book was very good on Kerouac's French-Canadian family background, his childhood, young adult years, and his time in the merchant marines.  However, when I came to the part where Kerouac meets fellow writers and other friends, Johnson really lost me.  There were so many unnecessary details about their lives that the book became tedious and boring.  It was also unfortunate that Johnson could not use quotes from Kerouac's books, but had to paraphrase everything.  Like other reviewers have said, this made me want to abandon Johnson's bio and re-read some of Kerouac's amazing work.  I also didn't like how the book suddenly stopped at 1951.  I would have liked to read about the rest of his life, including the reaction to such a groundbreaking book like On The Road.",2.0,Books,0,7

Often I will ride 2 miles with the lowest alert level going off, on a major highway with nothing around me, no idea why.<br /><br />The Cobra iRadar app is useless in the state I live, Michigan. I travel between GR, Kzoo, Lansing, Detroit, Ann Arbor, Midland, and never once has there been another user alert or one of there &#34;national database&#34; of common speed traps.  The only use for it is that when you are connected, the radar detector shows your speed and compass direction.  The speed I understand (needs GPS), but the direction should be shown regardless of phone connection.  I can buy a $5 digital direction tool that I stick to my dash, this could incorporate that technology easily. If not connected to phone it shows your battery voltage in huge numbers (useless?).<br /><br />There are so many common sense options that are missing I don't have the time.  The most obvious is for ME to set where I see speed traps often, even if they aren't there at that moment.  Nope.  Other detectors have this.  I should also remember where the false alerts are, nope. Again other detectors have this.  Every time I drive by lowes on my regular commute I have to hear the darn thing, no matter how many times I click ignore.<br /><br />I had my last radar detector 10 years ago, this is no better a decade later and at twice the price.

"Product width not as advertised!: If you have an opening that is between 38&#34; and 50&#34; DO NOT BUY this product. Yes you can make the gate + extension piece fit this opening, but the frame of the extension piece will cut into the already narrow walk-through space. I bought this to go across an opening that is 48&#34; wide. The frame of the extension piece impedes on the walk-through space by 2.5&#34;, taking the narrow 15.5&#34; opening down to 13&#34;. (don't take my word for 15.5&#34; being narrow, go get a measuring tape and hold it up for yourself. And despite the faulty product description, this seller (123stores) WILL NOT accept a return for a product that has been installed. Unfair, since I wouldn't have bought it if I knew that it wouldn't fit my door and I had no way of knowing that it wouldn't fit the door until I assembled it!<br /><br />In addition to this, the latch mechanism is cheap and challenging to open with one hand. Despite this, I don't know if I would trust that a kid wouldn't be able to figure it out (assuming they could reach it). Finally, the template that comes with the gate is off by 1/4&#34;. As in, you use the template correctly, screw the mounting hardware into your doorframe, and then try an put the gate in place and it locks on the bottom but doesn't on the top because the mounting hardware is 1/4&#34; too low. Now you've got extra holes in your door frame that are covered by the hardware, but will have to be patched if you ever remove the gate.",1.0,Pet_Supplies,0,26

He has passion for his job and the people around him. He and  his team will work 24 hours a day if necessary to solve a crime.<br /><br />I also like this series as, so far, there have not been any used of foul language or descriptive sex scenes. It is rare to find that in a mystery. If you want a good book that will hold you attention and has twist and turns with lots of good old fashion police work you will enjoy the Joe Gunther series.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"I love this printer!: I ask my wife frequently, &#34;Have I mentioned lately that I love this printer?&#34;<br /><br />I had an HP Somedangthingorother previously that irritated the heck out of my with its inability to do much of anything easily except for print text from our main computer.<br /><br />I bought this hoping for some sort of improvement. Imagine my joy when it does everything it is supposed to do with a great amount of ease! It prints! Quickly! From any of our computers / devices wirelessly! Without losing the connections to said devices!<br /><br />That in itself is fantastic, but it does so much more. I can scan with it, easily. Heck, I can even use the ADF to scan stuff in and it somehow manages to scan in both sides of a paper if asked to do so. I was dubious the first time I went to try it and it worked flawlessly. There are features I haven't even tried yet that I bet work wonderfully, like the card reader...and I haven't tried to print on odd-sized paper, but from everything I've seen so far, I'd be willing to bet it will work just as well. Oh, and while I don't print a ton of things in color, I have not yet changed either of the inks from the ones they sent with the printer.<br /><br />If I had one negative thing to say, it's a software issue. I have been scanning in my old photo albums and saving them offsite with a backup service and it's a bit annoying to have to suffix every scan with 001, 002, etc. Sometimes that can be handy, but the ability to turn off the automatic numbering would be a nice feature. Mom's cake recipe001.pdf is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyways, if I could give this thing six stars, I would. Kudos, Epson, I'll certainly look to you for any future printers.",5.0,Office_Products,1,24

"Detailed, Quirky and Funny Illustrations: Mr. Clutterbuck is reserved and quite boring during the day, consistently turning down offers from people to join them in fun activities. However during his sleepwalking expeditions he becomes a town hero by singlehandedly putting an end to the rivalry between two biker gangs, preventing the impending bankruptcy of the sausage factory and helping a rock band out of a rut, amongst other exciting things. Gus, Mr. Clutterbuck's faithful guinea pig, tags along to ensure Mr. Clutterbuck remains safe while he wanders around the town asleep.<br /><br />Translated from Finnish by Jill Timbers, I don't know if anything was lost in the translation but if it was it didn't matter. The names of the characters are a hoot! Rip and Roar are leaders of rival biker gangs, Wally Wurst is a hippopotamus that owns a sausage factory and one of the policemen is called Constable Fuzz!<br /><br />Kids are going to love hearing the jumbled words that come out of Mr. Clutterbuck's mouth when he's sleepwalking. I couldn't tell you why but Mr. Clutterbuck's voice in my head sounded exactly like Wallace from Wallace & Gromit.<br /><br />Kids and adults alike will enjoy finding new things in the pictures each time they open the book, like a car on a roof or a snake playing drums in a rock band. Even if you had no interest in this book based on the story I'd still recommend it for the illustrations alone. They're detailed, quirky, funny and the animals are fantastic!<br /><br />I've already spent a lot of time looking closely at all of the pictures to try and ensure I haven't missed anything but even so I'm sure I have. There's just so much to look at! Keep your eye out for the cutest fuzzy little spider with a top hat and cane in the majority of illustrations, adorable bats, and the spoon thief who's lurking around throughout the book.<br /><br />Thank you so much to NetGalley and Archipelago Books for the opportunity to read this book.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

I like the dual connector as I can use two tools without disconnecting and reconnecting tools. The handle is comfortable and balances the body nicely. Rubber feet protect customers floors and the noise level is quieter than most. The controls are easy to read and sensibly placed.  I have never understood the placement of the drain valve and like all my other compressors this one is places off center so you must rock and roll it around to get the accumulated water out, but there must be a reason as all compressors have this feature.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"INSPIRATIONAL- WORTH EVERY MOMENT: I grew up in a racially divided town, and my parents were not forward acting. By the time I could read, write and talk I immersed myself in the community surrounding me, but never got a chance to read this book. My young son and I came upon this video right before Christmas. We are a no TV family for the most part, but he loved the Grinch and I showed him the original cartoon. I took a chance, hoping there were other harmless, thoughtful videos available for a young audience I found this one. We were both instantly enchanted. I am a counselor/psychologist who works with children. I tend to look at the world through their eyes and so am typically sensitive to content, style, messaging, volume and use of tone and language. I ask the questions: does it make me want to be a better person? Does this video stay true to the story line? Does it frame real life? Does it inspire and mold behaviors that help the heart and mind of a child grow, learn and feel full? Yes, yes, yes, yes and yes for The Snowy Day. My now two year old son and I ran around for weeks saying, &#34;The more the merrier!&#34; We bought the book and a Peter doll for him to sleep with every night. We talked about how his community mirrors some of the characters and movements from the video. I have framed reflections of my child's experiences through the scenes in this story. Study's show conclusively that children learn resilience not from things always going their way but through their family conveying a true and honest narrative about life's ups and downs, and the family's ability to focus on loving each other through it all. Children want to know the truth so they can use the real clay of life to mold a life of their own. This video makes all our lives better. I am incredibly thankful for the staff that was involved in the production, script writing, music, narrative, tone, concept, imagery, and inclusivity. I wish I could give it an extra solid star for hitting their intended goal out of the park.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Love love love my Berkey: I am in love with my Berkey Water Purifier. Prior to purchasing the Berkey, I was not drinking enough water. However since receiving my Berkey, I have increased my water intake substantially. The increase is due to the fresh, clear taste of the water which does not have the smell or taste of regular filtered water. The water produced by the Berkey taste clean and does not have a after taste, which makes you feel satisfied and eager to drink more water. The Berkey is rather expensive but is worth the money when you consider the overall effect on your health due to a greater intake and a lack of contaminates in the water.

"WEJB's ""Sunny Side Up"" is HOT!!: I'm thrilled with the newest CD from the West End Jazz Band, ""Sunny Side Up""--they just keep getting better! Thanks to the brilliance of Mike Bezin's superb arrangements, and the disciplined hot, hard swinging of the band, this CD is tops. Mike has arranged eight Fletcher Henderson classics for the six-piece WEJB, and brings them to vivid life. Those gem-like charts would be worth the price of admission alone, but there is so much more to enjoy here--excellent dance medleys, novelties, star turns for every member of the band, ""La Rosita,"" nods to King Oliver and The Coon-Sanders Nighthawks, and an original interpretation of ""I'm Going to Float My Boat Right Back to Terre Haute.""<br /><br />This is the WEJB's first CD for Bryan Wright's excellent Rivermont label, and is beautifully packaged and produced, with delightful graphics by Dennis Scott (who is also the organist on their great ""Movie Palace Style"" CD).<br /><br />The musicianship here should be noted as well. Mike's own cornet, with its echoes of Bix and Joe Smith, provides just the right sound for the Henderson pieces and the hot dance selections. Reedman John Otto has just the right alto tone for 1920s music. Add to that the metronomic Leah Bezin on banjo, and the equally stellar Frank Gualtieri on trombone, Mike Albiniak on drums, and Mike Wallbridge on tuba, and you have one of the finest bands working today.<br /><br />My wife (who is not easily impressed) loved this CD and said that the WEJB sounds so authentic and true to the period that ""all they need are the scratches."" I concur. All their CDs are worth having, but you've got to buy ""Sunny Side Up.""",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Disjointed, grammatical errors, author notes still in ebook (?): Wanted to like this. I'm a fan of the Cussler-genre action novels, and was looking forward to finding a new author. This book, however, really disappoints.<br /><br />The basic story idea is good, but not exactly new ground here. Hero is the only hope against vast corporation. Big business throws impossible force to stop him. Good vs. evil, etc.<br /><br />But the story falls apart, with multiple (unnecessary) flashbacks to characters and events we already know the outcome of. And when I say multiple flashbacks, they are too common to count. It doesn't go to show character motivation, as much as it looks like ""I don't know where to go with this story next, maybe I should recount something already told once again.""<br /><br />Corporate evil, in this case utility distribution networks (!), are given a lot of leeway in their actions here. They control local sherrifs, black-ops mercenaries work in their offices, hi level politicians (with ties to the President), even the latest military spycraft (flying saucers!) are just a phone call away. Thank God our hero went to West Point, or all hope would be lost.<br /><br />Most annoying is that there appear to be notes from the author in the ebook, reflecting perhaps that even he is confused by his own story. There is an exchange between black-ops agents tracking our hero where the following passage appears in brackets:<br /><br />>>>>>  [Is this Eagle Six speaking? Shooter One? Thought it was Eagle Six, but that's who speaks next].<br /><br />And then Eagle six speaks. Seems our author lost track of his own story here. But it shows a lack of proofreading here, which is rife throughout the book. Lots of grammatical errors throughout the book.<br /><br />Overall, not very well written, too many flashbacks spoil the story flow, not well edited.<br /><br />Sorry Matt, but this book has too many flaws to recommend.  Better luck next time.",1.0,Books,0,7

"Poor sensors (multiple helmets tried): I really wanted to like this helmet. I‚Äôve been sporting a Weldmark ($90) since I got into welding about 4 years ago and after reading all the hype I was psyched to upgrade to something top of the line. I would say that this helmet lives up to all of it with the unfortunate exception of the fact that I frequently end up getting flashed when using these helmets. I‚Äôve tried 4 different Speedglas helmets in the last few months, 2 belonging to friends, then I bought the 9100xx, which must have had faulty sensors from the get go as I got flashed badly multiple times within less than 30 seconds of welding. I returned that and took it down a notch to the 9100, which is much better but still flashes me from time to time. It‚Äôs really disappointing because the clarity and window size of these helmets are outstanding when they work, but that hardly seems worth the occasional (at least once a day) flash. I‚Äôm going back to my Weldmark for the time being, which doesn‚Äôt have the same lens quality, but I‚Äôve never had a sensor failure and that‚Äôs more important than any other attribute you could hope for in a mask (if you‚Äôre asking me).<br />If you end up going with a Speedglas I hope you have a better experience as everything else about them seems top of the line, Im just done shopping around at the expense of my eyesight.",2.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,0,30

"Flawed design, should have been better: I have been using OtterBox cases for some time but have never used Defender cases before. I decided to try it out because OtterBox does not offer Commuter cases for Pixel 4 XL. While this Defender case seem to offer good protection there are some flaws, for example the side raised edges are too high and make swiping from sides inconvenient. The case frame also has creaking sound when squeezed from sides, probably due to hard plastic used with snapping frame around the phone.<br /><br />It would have been much better if it had a construction similar to the Commuter case for Galaxy S9+ where the side edges are basically flush with display allowing easy swiping on display while the raised edges on top and bottom sides still offer enough protection for display. The Commuter on S9 also had better construction with black rubber actually hugging the phone and hard plastic cover on top of black rubber which prevented any creaking sounds. Perhaps OtterBox will do that when they will release the Commuter case for Pixel 4. And I hope they will do it soon because all of OtterBox offerings for Pixel 4 models are pretty poor right now.",3.0,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,0,9

"Intelligent, Hilarious, and Deeply Moving (with great DVD Extras): This? Is a great movie about loss and love that isn't dreary or heavy, but lighter than air.<br /><br />It's funny, tender, moving, and intelligent.  If I had to name a personal favorite, although I have thousands in my ""top 100 list"" this movie would be it. Minghella just wrote something delicate and funny, human, compassionate, and that exudes not only a love for people in all their differences, but that also just as wonderfully exudes a love of music and of literature.<br /><br />Telling the story of Nina, a woman coping with a devastating loss, the script is whimsical and lighter than air and yet about some incredibly big, deep stuff. Juliet Stevenson is hilarous, klutzy, befuddled, and lovable as Nina -- sweetly goofy in some scenes, and then absolutely wrenching in others. And it's great to see Alan Rickman in a rare (and very charming) romantic leading role as Jamie (who knew he could sing?). Michael Maloney's role is tougher in some ways, but he has a touching and quite charismatic opening scene, as well as one of the funniest first-date-scenes I've ever seen.<br /><br />Ultimately, Truly Madly Deeply is a lovely, resonant story about grownups who don't talk like they're in a movie. The performances are fantastic, the romantic triangle is unique and likeable, and every character is a memorable and believable person you're happy to have met, from the romantic Polish handyman, to Nina's prickly yet big-hearted Scottish boss (a fabulous Bill Paterson), to the philosophical rat exterminator (who's pretty sure rats can talk to each other), to Nina's best friend, a very pregnant Spanish filmmaker who manages to keep a cheery attitude even when forced to clean houses for a living. Everyone we meet in the movie is smart, individual, and delightful (even the ghosts, who spend most of their afterlife watching movies on borrowed VCRs).<br /><br />The DVD itself looks great, with a few notable informational tidbits and features. My favorite special feature is the smart, funny, and fascinating DVD commentary from director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella (better known for ""The English Patient"") -- Minghella's commentary is as rich and interesting as the movie itself, like having him over to dinner to discuss life, death, love, and film.<br /><br />Ultimately, Truly Madly Deeply is a wonderful experience. It's also a great reminder in these sometimes difficult post-9-11 times, that -- for anyone who's ever lost a loved one, the sun does keep shining (even when the feet want to march elsewhere).",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Great guide, great information, extremely helpful: I've found it difficult to get detailed, actionable advice for visiting places off the beaten path in China.  Most guidebooks cover the cities really well, but when getting away from the big coastal cities, most don't have the depth or insight to be valuable.<br /><br />Josh Summers has done a great job of providing visibility into Xinjiang in a way that I hadn't seen before, and I've been traveling to China since 2000.  This is the guidebook I'd been waiting for.  If you want to visit this area, this is the book you need.<br /><br />Really hoping he expands to Gansu province in the near future - I could sure use a guidebook to there before my next vacation!",5.0,Books,1,7

"Notes From The Big Chair: I am a large guy. 5'10&#34; and 215 lbs. I needed a chair that wasn't &#34;professional&#34;, (in the $500-$600 price range), but was comfortable, able to hold me, and shared features found on more expensive chairs. I worked in offices for thirty five years, and a call center for a decade, so I have sat in many different office chairs.<br />This chair was easy to assemble, and it has served me well for many months. The arm rests are perfect, (although I don't dare put too much weight on them), The padded seat is not too soft, not too hard, just right. The mesh back is cool and allows airflow, and has just the right stiffness when leaning back.<br />I would definitely buy this chair again.",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

They just sat and watched it twirl all around but would not play at all with it. It came with a magnetic feather that attaches to the inside which was pretty cool and 3 balls that swirl around when the toy is on, it also plays a bird chirping noise which my cats really didn‚Äôt seem to like‚Ä¶they actually ran away from the toy instead of towards it. When I took the balls out they would play with them that way and toss them around. Overall seems like it would be a cute toy but my cats could care less.

"Sheets constantly bunch up and retains heat - constantly waking up too hot: I don't quite understand why this happens, but the bottom fitted bed sheets I have used constantly get pulled into the middle of the mattress when I'm sleeping.  This causes the sheets to bunch up and have folds.  I also constantly wake up very hot, from what I believe is a combination of the mattress itself not having good cooling properties and the bed sheet folds trapping the warm air.<br /><br />I've used two different sets of bed sheets of different mattress thickness sizes and both produce the same issue.  My previous mattress never had an issue like this with the same sheets.  My guess is that it might be because the edges of the mattress are more rounded and softer than a typical mattress.<br /><br />If I didn't have this issue for me, I wouldn't have hesitated to give it 5 stars.  It's very comfortable for the price.",3.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

"Best American film of the nineties!: Hands-down my favourite American film of the nineties. Curtis Hanson shocked the world by proving to be not only a great director but an auteur with this unbeatable adaptation of James Ellroy's terrifying novel about corruption and crime among members of the LAPD in the 1950s. The hard-boiled detective story angle is brought to life so beautifully, mostly because Jeannine Claudia Oppewall's production design recreates the dark underside of the 50s to such perfection that not even a Coke bottle label is missed. Add to that Dante Spinotti's stunning lighting that rides the fine line between artistic and believable comfortably (as all period camerawork should), Ruth Myers' costume designing and a script by Hanson and The Postman scribe Brian Helgeland (I know, I don't get it either) that pares down Ellroy's mammoth plot about a multiple murder in a local diner involving a policeman with suspicious ties without sacrificing the density of the story or the spiderweb of events involved with it, and you have the best movie of 1997, not to mention the most fascinating detective film ever made since Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. The cast is all brilliant, most notably Kim Basinger as a wordly prostitute who has not only a heart of gold but a mind of steel--Basinger is so strong in her character's every nuance you'll find yourself forgetting she's even acting--and Kevin Spacey as a Dean Martin-esque detective who not only solves an important part of the puzzle, he even discovers he possesses a soul beneath his flashy suits. I just can't get enough of this film.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

This is Chris from The Tester's List and today I am going to be talking about an awesome product that is great for protecting surfaces that you have appliances or devices on. The Heavy Duty Round Self Adhesive Felt Pads from ALLTough are a great product to have on hand. The pack comes with 144 round felts pads and comes in an assortment of sizes. If you are like me and have wood furnishing that you keep either heavy electronics or appliances on, then this is a great product to own. All you have to do is place the felt pads on the bottom of your desired items, try to get at least 4 of them on, and after doing so they will protect your furnishing from being scratched or damaged ultimately preserving the beauty and making it last a lot longer. Since this pack comes with an assortment of sizes the pads are perfect for any desired sized item you wish to put them on. These would even be great for protecting your wood flooring from the legs of furniture using the larger size felt pads. This is definitely a great product to own and I would highly recommend them.

"Hilarious and Real to Life: Susan Corpany is a comic genius. I found myself laughing aloud as I read Lucky Change. The story centers on a wacky, not-too-bright Mormon woman who semi-accidentally purchases a single lottery ticket--and wins $230 million. She and her children have always been the congregation's charity case, and she is thankful that now she has a chance to give back some of the good that has been done for her over the years. The pitfalls of sudden wealth are all around her. Avoiding them (for herself and her two grown children), including gold-digging suitors who come out of the woodwork, is the challenge. The dialogue and situations are so real, I felt like I knew every single person in the whole cast of the book by the 50th page, and was totally invested in them all by the end of the book, which was very uplifting, by the way. Such a worthwhile read, in spite of being light and frothy. Delightful! I can see why it was on the short list for the Whitney Awards last year. It's a fun read about Mormons, but it would be delightful for any reader wanting a clean, uplifting, hilarious read.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Masterful suspense.: While I think I enjoy the character of Ruiz better in the Robotham series, it seems that Joe O'Loughlin has been the hero of my two favourites, Shatter and now Say You're Sorry.  (But of course, I have also given my heart to Luca, the hero of The Wreckage, a highly recommended international intrigue.)<br /><br />Say You're Sorry is a gripping page turner where you are presented with a slew of possible villains ... each one capable and a reasonable choice as the perpetrator.  But in your head you keep piecing information together (helped by Joe), discounting your last ""Ahh Haa"" moment and moving on to your next ""maybe-its-???"" consideration.<br /><br />Sorry, no more ... no spoilers.  I shall have to come back for a rewrite after the release.<br /><br />The narrative is presented from two viewpoints : Joe and the victim, a young girl held hostage (and that is another great plot device ... keeping you guessing as to her fate).  All the vulnerability and worldly bravado of a teenager were well written in the ""voice"" of the Piper, as were the intricacies of her family dynamics.",5.0,Books,1,7

Besides the main compartment, this also has 2 side pockets, a pocket in the back, slots for pens/pencils, the large front pocket has 4 smaller pockets inside while the main compartment has additional pockets in it.<br /><br />This is made of high quality and thick polyester which is waterproof and anti-scratch. What makes this backpack different is the USB port on the side which I can use if I need to charge my electronic devices hands-free. The anti-theft feature is the best as you would have to open the backpack zipper all the down to where the straps are. The straps also mini pockets with button enclosures.<br /><br />The search for a backpack to replace my laptop bag is finally over. You can't beat the price for having the convenience, comfortability and durability all in one product.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

The zipper only opens about 1/3 of the top of the bag, so I'm not sure how useful it will be.

"Not the horror people say it is: As everyone knows, TH wrote a screenplay and based this novel off that screenplay. On first reading of the novel, I was very disappointed. I guess after 7 years waiting, expectations run high. This is especially the case if you think that ""Hannibal"" was a great novel, which I think it was. For me, ""Hannibal Rising"" was slapped together, too light on character development, and read like a bad novelization of what must be a mediocre screenplay.<br /><br />So I read it again.<br /><br />I totally see what TH was trying to do and, mostly, he did a masterful job. The problem is that Hannibal has become such a large character that people have their own ideas. People wanted Hannibal to act a specific way and didn't like ""Hannibal""; now people have filled in the blanks on Hannibal's childhood and are disappointed with ""Hannibal Rising.""<br /><br />But this is young Hannibal, his roots, and TH does an excellent job of showing the scenes that got him to where he is without psycho-analyzing Hannibal and his motivations. It's very detatched, perhaps more so than any of the other Hannibal novels, and I really appreciate that. I love how Hannibal handles encounters with understanding cops and other doctors. We are not let inside Hannibal's mind, but we witness the choices he makes and are shown a youthful, irrational, but brilliant young man coming to terms with emotions that he can't handle (in large part because he lives through horrific events where he is the victim) and stifles them to get what he wants. We see scenes where Hannibal clearly understands right and wrong and validates his behaviour. It almost excuses him, and that's part of the brilliance of the novel - creating a past that almost makes Hannibal sympathetic. It's a perfect set up for how Hannibal becomes the man he is.<br /><br />I would like to have seen more, especially some more non-violent scenes that explore other sides of Hannibal. TH explains in his opening why the scenes feel short and jumbled and he sticks with that. It's not the genius we've seen in his other works, but it's still well worth the read. I am curious to see the movie now, but can't help think both would have been better had the novel come first and the screenplay come second.<br /><br />I know many people are begging TH to quit Hannibal now, but I wouldn't mind one more book filling in the gap between his arrival in the US and his capture by Will Graham in Red Dragon. Too many people are riding this off as TH cashing in on Hannibal, but I feel he has stayed true to the character he created and as long as he does that, I'm up for reading more.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Good Follow-up album to Human!!!: Three Days Grace has been around for a while now and have been popular pretty much since they started. I have listened to them off and on for many years. Outsider is a follow up to their debut album with Matt Walst on lead vocals and it is a good follow up to Human. My one complaint is the song length for quite a few of the songs is rather short, but that's not all bad. I think they wanted radio play, so I don't really blame them. Anyway, there's not one song on here that I don't like and not really a filler song ,in my opinion. Overall, Outsider is a good effort by Three Days Grace. I am not blown away by it, but I do enjoy listening to it and will continue to support Three Days Grace in the future!

"Consider Wisely, Good Claims, Poor Results: If you are in the market for an automatic pool cleaner get a robotic one.

While I can't speak for the individuals, my guess about why others' mowers are stalling or weak probably strongly correlate to lack of maintenance.  If you buy this, take care of it.  It's expensive.  That means that, come the end of season, you need to stabilize its fuel or it won't perform.  It also means that, come beginning of next, you need to change its oil, filter, and (eventually) spark plug.  Bad fuel or low maintenance will undoubtedly give you problems.  Invest the $10 a year and 30 minutes to keeping it top notch and I'm confident it will make the long-haul.  I've had equipment that is a little bit more lenient on maintenance but it's a trade-off.  They've never worked as well as this guy, and I wouldn't expect them to.<br /><br />That said, I'm especially leery of the lawn mowers that boast low- or no-maintenance motors.  I can't believe that someone out there has discovered &#34;never needs an oil change!&#34; technology because that isn't how oil works.  It has to degrade.  Personally, I feel that they're banking on people not running equipment hard or long and -- ultimately -- replacing it before the oil would get so bad that you'd seize it.  This is a legit lawn mower.  It is plenty happy working and I beg you, please take care of it.  Do that and it'll be around for many, many moons.<br /><br />I'll come down from my maintenance soap box now and tell you a bit more about this specific greatness that is a lawn mower.<br /><br />CUTTING PERFORMANCE (5/5)<br />We can throw everything out and start here.  If the answer to &#34;Yeah, but how well does it cut?&#34; is, &#34;terribly&#34;, then we have a serious problem.  Luckily, that's not this mower's motivation in life.  I use it as a mulcher and it has done a spectacular job.  Keep the revs up using the throttle and the chute on and the grass gets evenly distributed every single pass.  We don't have a fancy yard so it's a mix of a bunch of different grass types and it cuts them all even and equally well.  The lawn looks great after every mow.<br /><br />That said, the wife demands that I put in here it still doesn't look as nice as a lawn cut with our &#34;old&#34; Fiskars push mower.  If you have a smaller yard and don't mind providing the oomph, it's hard to top those.  We recently moved to a house with a 1/3 acre and it was just too physically demanding.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY (5/5)<br />This thing's built like a tank.  It's definitely not a lightweight and I'm happy about that.  Pulling it backwards is a bit more of a pain than other options, but it has plenty of power to do the hard work for you.<br /><br />I also love the side discharge chute, which sounds odd.  It's flexible which you'll love the first time you inevitably run it into something.  In mulch mode, the rear flap has a nice &#34;plug&#34; to ensure the mower bottom stays round.  This does tend to get plugged with grass but I personally don't mind it.  You can pull it open and push the grass out or use the mower's fancy hose cleanout feature.<br /><br />I haven't collected the clippings, so I can't weigh in, but I do like that you can like the side discharge chute closed.<br /><br />Also a huge fan of the clutch system.  If you have a bit of a walk between areas, just let go of the mower bar and drive the mower over.  Also great for stopping to pick stuff up.  It quiets the mower significantly as well if you need to shout something at the dog and/or family.<br /><br />DRIVE SYSTEM (5/5)<br />Honestly, this impressed me the most.  First, real-wheel drive is better (in my humble opinion) than the all-wheel and especially front-wheel drive systems.  Think of how you maneuver a lawn mower.  You pick up the front and wiggle it on its rear wheels.  RWD ensures that you have those wheels powered.  We don't have an extraordinarily steep lawn but it can easily get itself up and down the big ditches and grades.<br /><br />Secondly, the hand controls are actually throttle and they're brilliant!  A bit touchy at first, they take a mow or two to get dialed in.  Once you do, though, you can give it a little less throttle to wiggle around tight areas, just a hair to go into the deep weeds or grass, then open it up in the straights.  Yes, I am a car guy :-)<br /><br />OTHER FEATURES (5/5)<br />The single-point deck adjustment is awesome.  We don't do a ton of adjusting but I'm a tall guy and have always found it annoying to go around to every wheel adjusting its height.  WHY DO MOWERS EXIST WITHOUT THIS OPTION?!<br /><br />Hose cleanout is really cool as well.  Every few mows, you just hook up the garden hose, fire up the mower and let it self-clean its interior, then disconnect the water and let it run to dry.  You seriously could not ask for an easier way to clean out a mower.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />In all, you couldn't ask for more from a mower.  It's built to last, offers you pretty much anything you could ask for from a mower, and is built to last.  Take care of it and it will take care of you.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"This is one of the first books I ever remember reading that I really enjoyed: This review has been crossposted from my blog at The Cosy Dragon.com. Please head there for more in-depth reviews by me, which appear on a timely schedule.<br /><br />Artemis is a criminal mastermind - and he's only 12. Set to restore the family fortune by crook, he is prepared to separate fairies from their gold to do it. Guarded only by Butler and Juliet, he needs to outwit a troll and the rest in order to get his gold. And in the end, will he be able to escape death?<br /><br />Artemis is rather a flat character, in which the reader knows little about him except that after being left to his own devices after his father's disappearance he is determined to not lose the family home despite his mother's disabilities. You know that there must be something deeper going on in his mind, because he can't be a bad guy all the way through, right?<br /><br />This is a plot driven novel, with little attention given to landscape details and the like. You will find yourself liking the characters though, and Colfer guides the reader through different perspectives nicely through use of a detached faux scientific journal. There is an 'introduction' which introduces you to Artemis, but it don't pay nearly enough homage to his brilliance (and Colfer's by extension).<br /><br />There are constant references to things that will occur in the future, and will be detailed in other books, which I think is a good way of putting a hook in for the reader. Younger readers are sure to enjoy it, male or female. Adults are unlikely to appreciate Artemis in the same way, but oh well, it's not intended for them!<br /><br />I hesitated to file this book under 'action', but it was the closest I could get under my current labeling scheme. I've also labelled it fantasy, due to the fairy aspect, but perhaps it is more like urban fantasy. I struggle with the definitions, I either like a book or I don't!<br /><br />I can still remember bringing my copy of this book to high school with me in maybe grade 7 or 8, and reading it with a close friend of the time. We both had copies, but we found it sociable to read the same copy! I always remember being jealous of his copy, because it was in so much better condition than mine. My copy is pictured above - the cover is really shiny and hard to photograph! I'm pretty sure you wouldn't find the same cover anymore anyway, as the design changed after the first 3 books.<br /><br />This is one of the first books I ever remember reading that I really enjoyed, and have kept reading over again and enjoying each time. Totally worth it to buy the rest of the books in the series (that I am going to read + review next), although I feel that the last couple of books don't pack the same zing.",5.0,Books,1,7

"absolutely fantastic!: So far I have cooked two fantastic meals with this great device.  I cooked salmon filets using the griddle - didn't know how hard it would be to get the fish skin out of the ridges of the grill - and they came out just great.  They cooked faster than in the oven and were cooked perfectly.  I also grilled steaks using just the grill and they were cooked to perfection!  I used the built-in thermometer, set the temperature I wanted, and a few minutes later, my steaks were just right.  The grill was very easy to clean.  I can't imagine when I will my oven again!!<br /><br />Update:  I am having trouble using the thermometer.  Tonight I set the temperature to 135.  Everything started out great, but when it told me to flip the meat over, it said the temperature was rising very quickly and a couple of minutes later it said the meat was done.  I didn't believe it so I got out my trusty meat thermometer and it said the meat was 95 degrees - quite a bit off of 135.  I then had to turn the grill back on for 10 minutes and just kept checking the meat with my trusty meat thermometer until it got to the right temperature.  The connected thermometer worked great the first few times I used it, but the last few, I have had the same problem I had tonight.<br /><br />The steak came out great, but I was a lot more involved in the process than I was hoping to be.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

The first pair were manufactured in China were a perfect fit, lasted a long time and were great. Every pair since was manufactured in Vietnam. The Vietnam made Chelsea boots are bigger than listed on the box and the boot itself. Like atleast half a size bigger I've returned a few pairs and every pair from Vietnam is too large.<br /><br />The quality control in Vietnam manufactured docs is terrible. Leather quality is inconsistent as each pair ends up with leather splits in different places. The elastic always gives out and the boots get loose in the ankles.

"Excelllent documentary: I found this movie an eye opener, if a bit melodramatic, the facts are nevertheless accurate. It is a fact that the ""Democratic Socialists"" have burrowed deep into Democratic Party, are receiving advice from European Communists, and  gradually subverting the Democratic Party, pushing it further and further left.<br />The founders of Black Lives Matter admit they are ""trained Marxists."" If you donate to BLM the site directs you to ""Act Blue,' the Democratic fund raising site. No wonder Democratic candidates promise the uproar will continue. All the riots and burning buildings are great fund raisers for the DNC.<br /><br />Another example of our vulnerability; a Chinese national named Yu Ben Meng.  Despite being a Chinese national and a member of China's top spy organization, he's the chief investment officer for CALPERS, the largest public pension fund in the U.S.  Meng was recruited by China's spy agency, the Thousand Talent Program. Meng has used this position to invest in Chinese companies that build up their military and put our country at risk.<br />Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib have participated in raising money for Hamas, a known terrrorist organization. Hamas has donated large sums to many Democratic politicians.<br />If you want a less melodramatic analysis of our national security, order Andrew McCarthy's book, ""The Grand Jihad.""McCarthy is the former US Attorney who convicted the Blind Sheikh, mastermind of the 1993 WTC bombing. It describes the symbiotic relationship of radical Islam and the Left, and how they operate to fragment Western Society.

"You will need at least 4-5 bundles: I posted pictures of the hair in different states.  The only thing I really dislike is how thin the bundles are.  I ordered 3 bundles 20, 22 & 24 however because the bundles were so thin I ended up having to purchase a 26 inch bundle from my local beauty supply store because I was getting a sewin  done that day. Also I did notice black residue on my wand curlers when I curled the hair . I know it was from Amelia bundles because the residue came off when I curled the top part as well. It curled pretty good tho but was puffy looking however the curls came back when I washed it just looser. Other than that surprisingly I haven't had any major issues with shedding in fact I haven't noticed much shedding at all. This hair doesn't tangle much  for it to be curly hair. On a scale of 1-5 I would say the tangling is probably a 2.5 . I do detangle it prior to shampoo/ conditioning it and then I use a deep curly define cream which has the curls popping even when it dries. For the price you pay it's worth it to me besides the thin bundles.  My advice would be to not over do it with  products  and maybe wash it twice a week defining the curls with a define curl cream so you won't have to deal with it everyday. I purchased this hair  on 10/13, It came over night 10/14, Got it installed later that day and I still have it in as of today which is 11/3. It will probably last you a good 1-3 months with proper care. You will need about 4-5 bundles maybe even 6 if you want a full look.",4.0,Beauty_and_Personal_Care,1,6

I can't even lift the pan to transfer the food into a serving dish.  Lifting 6-7 pounds (pan plus ingredients) at the end of a long handle is nearly impossible.

"AWFUL PLOT, HORRIBLE TREATMENT OF CHARACTER RAPE: This book totally ruined this series for me. First off, the sorceress plot line makes zero sense. She (or her soulblade) can control 50 or more people at a time and alter their memories and she can mask her aura (or her soulblade can) to other magic users and she can disguise her appearance. How would she need Ridge to get into the capital city to get to the king? It‚Äôs not the like the capital had amazing security. She could have easily snuck (or walked boldly) in at any time. And then the horrible treatment of a character rape. Ridge hoping Sardelle would forgive him for having his mind tampered with and then him being drugged and raped. Like other reviewers have commented, this was handled particularly poorly. DNF. Very very disappointing after investing the time in the 6 other books to end up not finishing this steaming pile of dragon dung.",1.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"An Extremely Enjoyable Voyage of Discovery: An amazing, amazing book.  Rigel Crockett's evocative writing style brings an authenticity to this work that makes the reader feel a part of the voyage.  Anyone who has spent time crewing aboard a tall ship will immediately appreciate Crockett's ability to capture all the excitement, boredom and wonder of life on a square-rigger.  Reading this book, I felt as though I was part of the Picton Castle crew; working the lines, watching relationships form and dissolve, enjoying with wide eyes each exotic port and doggedly weathering every storm.  This is a work I very highly recommend to all who have sailed aboard a tall ship, or have dreamed of doing so.  Crockett allows us to witness not only the dynamics of the crew in relation to each other and their ship, but his own inner-dynamics.  We are given the opportunity to experience this world journey just as he experienced it, with the joys of new discovery and the frustrations of everyday life.<br /><br />Extremely well-written with a rare descriptive power to transport the reader totally into Crockett's world, this book works as a travel journal, a personal journey of discovery, an introduction to square-rig sailing and a record of a most amazing and unusual voyage.  It is rare to find a book so absolutely enjoyable as ""Fair Wind and Plenty of It.""  My thanks to Rigel Crockett for allowing us to join him in his journey.",5.0,Books,1,7
"Totally impressed!: I have an older (1060) Honda Accord with over 250,000 miles on it. I don't drive it often, and as you can guess, the battery dies. After a recent cold spell I found that my ancient battery charger had died also. So while searching online for a charger, I came across the Brightech ad and decided to give it a try, not really confident that it would work, but impressed by the reviews. I ordered one, charged it overnight, and tried it on the Honda. Nothing. But I decided to give it another shot after warming the motor up. I jump started the car using my Toyota and, taking the Brightech with me, drove 30 miles to town. I parked facing down a hill before shutting the motor off, figuring that if the battery hadn't charged enough to start the car, I could coast it to start if the Brightech didn't work. Well, the battery was still dead, but the Brightech started the motor instantly. Not only once, but also after the next three times I stopped to shop. It still showed 3 green lights, and I discovered that my original problem was not getting into the car quickly enough to hit the starter within the 30 second window before the Brightech went back to sleep. After I got home, I parked the Honda (battery still dead-dead cell?) and let it sit for 2 weeks. This afternoon I hooked it up to the Brightech again (which, by the way, still showed a full charge) and it cranked over like crazy and started it!  Marvelous little tool! I also love that it has a carrying case to keep everything together, and though I haven't used it to charge any of my electronic devices yet, I have every confidence that it will. I carry it with me and keep an eye out for folks with dead batteries, to show it off.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

Leaving the Great Salt Lake they are following the railroad hoping the small towns along the route will bring their search to an end & they will find in some small settlement the twins, Vivian & Frank that Pamela Tarleton hid from Conrad before her death.  Pamela's final, vengeful act was to leave a letter with her cousin to be delivered to Conrad.

Pamela says that she has hidden them somewhere along the way in her journey from Boston to San Francisco & that Conrad will never find them.<br />This time in the search Conrad & Arturo will be sidetracked by six avenging angels & the lovely Selena Webster.

Concepts of a clean, functional and beautiful tomorrow are showcased in this book , which was originally a mere sales brochure for high end businessmen in the steel industry at the dawn of the 60s. First in a series of publications produced by US Steel, ""Concepts"" ushered in a new era of slick, ultra-realistic depictions of an ideal utopian society that wedded functionality with ergonomics and an aesthetic style that still appears modern today. Surely a unique and  important book whose value as a chronicle of emerging futurist ideals will only grow more relevant with the passage of time.",5.0,Books,1,7

"I really like them: First a note on size - I suggest that if in doubt, order a touch smaller than you think.  These will stretch, and really this style of glove looks a bit odd if worn loose.<br /><br />This said, I think they fit pretty well to size.  They are snug without being restrictive.  The snap is really quite secure and I had no problems with it.  Construction is also very good, not a small thing if you consider that the seams may be under stress until the glove conforms to your hand.<br /><br />Quite comfortable, and frankly I prefer these to full finger gloves when it comes to driving or just wearing them for style.  No lining, no padding, just the leather.  I really like these gloves.",5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

"Exceeds Expectations - Much Better than Tribit XSound Go: Very impressed with this portable Bluetooth speaker.  It pairs with my iPhone 8 easily, and has AWESOME sound for its small size.  Sound clarity does not deteriorate at high volumes, and the XBass selection is a nice feature.  For the price, I don't think you can do much better.  However, the Tribit MaxSound Plus is definitely worth the extra $10 over the slightly smaller, Tribit XSound Go.  I originally purchased the XSound Go, but was not impressed with the sound at higher volumes.  It was not capable of providing good sound for more than a single listener.  I returned it and got this model, and it was not noticeably that much bigger than the XSound Go, but the sound quality was so much better.  The MaxSound Plus is easily capable for providing nice sound for a small gathering.  Highly recommend this model.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Not worth the money: I am a DJ and I used it approx 4 times and it has already malfunctioned. The sound activation does not work and I can only use it in still mode now, which defeats the purpose of having a dance light. It is only good for small rooms that hold 50-75 people (standing/dancing)with little to no light present. If the space is any bigger than that and has any light in it at all, forget it. There is no on or off switch which is annoying. If you need a light for more than 2- 3 hours at a time, spend the extra $60 and get a better light than this one.

It was a marked departure from other rest of the films in many ways. But most bothersome was how hard it was to see the images, even on Apple TV 4K w/ a high-end LG OLED TV. Rather than too ""washed out"" there it was too much contrast and it really impacted the viewing experience in a bad way.<br /><br />I thought the Alien Predator beast was very underwhelming.

He also gives a lot of good illustrations as he shares his principles relating to weight loss.

It's compact, paired I'm 10 secs once I acrivated the bt icon on the S5. I bought 2 other speakers from different manufacturer's and they where just ad simple to pair. Just make sure you have the speaker charged and if you are using a app, such as amazon music, or my music, make sure you have your volume high enough because if it's low, the sound out of the speaker will be low and you might think it's a speaker  issue, it's Not. Once your volume on your player app is up, so will the sound out of the speaker. For the price and size, I think my girls will love this speaker for sound smooth sounds during lunch or whenever.

"Something lost in translation?: Like the previous reviewer, I very much like the production of the Peirene books, and love having otherwise inaccessible authors translated for an English-speaking audience eager to read these authors.<br /><br />However, unlike the previous reviewer, I completely disagree about the quality of the writing...or the translation.  The language is not exquisite, but overly pedantic, containing much that does nothing to propel the plot or dialogue--the book could have been much shorter without useless statements such as: ""He blinks"".  On the one hand, overtly flowery language is a hindrance if the writer has nothing compelling to say, but on the other, it can also be too banal--which it is in the case of this book.  The writer stretched out the plot in a nice fashion, keeping you guessing as to the motive for the boxer's (Danny's) flight to Pamplona, but it was painful to get there.  The Robert character is cardboard stiff and uninteresting--the most interesting passages are those of Danny's recollection of his dealings with his trainer and promoter, and with the love interest. There is nothing to believe in any connection between Robert and Danny, nor Danny's sense of obligation to Robert.  There is also very little development of characters as a whole that surround the main character.<br /><br />This series is a wonderful idea, and beautifully produced, but either the translations are too simplistic and un-evocative of the writers' own languages, or the writers themselves have been ill-advisedly chosen for this series.<br /><br />A big disappointment for me, though I had much hope.",1.0,Books,0,7

"This Thing of Ours, by Cammy Franzese: In a nutshell, this is the story of Cammy Franzese's marriage to mobster Michael Franzese and how she lived while he spent eight years in prison. I would say it's really more of an overview, because she doesn't go into any great detail about anything. As Michael has books of his own out about his old mafia life, perhaps she felt that had already been covered. Her point in this particular book seems to be that God wanted her to stick it out with this guy and blessed her because she did.<br />To be honest, I had a difficult time relating to the author. I know she was very young when she fell in love and married this man, but she seemed to be awfully, and may I say willfully, clueless. It's the willful part that makes her a less sympathetic character in my opinion.<br />I want to like this book, because I think the overall message is intended to be positive, and perhaps if I knew more of the story I would like it better, but with the little information the author gives in this particular volume I found it hard to ""get into"" what she is trying to say. The feeling I came away with was that I'm glad it worked out for her, but she - and he - asked for all the trouble they had along the way!<br />I reviewed this book for the booksneeze.com blogger book review program and received a free copy of the book in return for my honest review.

"One of my Top 10 Favorite Books of All Time: My first exposure to Richard Russo came via the movies. Specifically, the film rendition of 'Nobody's Fool' (I cannot resist anything featuring Paul Newman). I fell in love with the film, and all of its quirky, lovable characters, and debated for quite a while before picking up the book. Would reading it tarnish the esteem in which I held the movie? Film versions of books are notoriously horrid ('The Princess Bride' is a notable exception). Would I end up wishing I had never read the cursed manuscript?<br />Oh no. Emphatically no. This is a wonderful book, full of lyricism, real people, and the engaging, bittersweet story I have to come to expect from Mr. Russo. His painting of small-town New England life is full of colorful details and a clarity that reminds me of Hemingway, although I never felt as drawn to any of Hemingway's characters as I do to those in 'Nobody's Fool.' The reluctant protagonist, Donald Sullivan ('Sully'), is both irresistable and infuriating. His ridiculously comic best friend Rub and his perpetually optimistic land-lady Miss Beryl are on-the-money portaits of genuine people. The interplay between Sully and his sometimes-boss, all-the-time nemesis Carl is worth the read alone. As is typical with film versions of books, the book is a good deal deeper, and darker, than the movie. The descriptions of Sully's childhood growing up with an abusive parent have stayed with me, although in no way do they resort to grisly details to pack their punch.<br />The book and the film are different entities; two separate and excellent pieces of work. I have not read all of Mr. Russo's works, but a good number of them, and 'Nobody's Fool' is still my favorite. You will laugh out loud at Sully's antics, fall in love with the characters, and marvel and the fine writing in this book.",5.0,Books,1,7
"Bad rap getting into the way of good jazz: Indigo Jam Unit is without a doubt the best jazz I have ever found. However, I was very disappointed to hear the rap on this album. It might be forgiven if it was spoken word (poetic/beatnik style... IJU would be perfect for it), but it's simply hip hop sprinkled with some 'N' bombs. This album is cringe worthy... Like watching your child die.<br /><br />Japan has some of the best jazz these days (nue/acid jazz) and Indigo Jam Unit tops them all. If you want some real good music get their ""Realism"" album (or Pirates or Collectivity or 2x2). It is beyond jazz and has a very distinct rhythm and bass line. This band is so good I had to import the other albums from Japan.<br /><br />I would have given this album 1 star, but this band is so good I didn't have the heart and bumped it up to 2.",2.0,Unknown,0,32

"Good Reading: Jason and Miranda had been young and completely in love with each other. Jason wanted to marry her, but he was going away to college and Miranda had decided to stay and get a local degree. Jason wanted to believe their love could survive the long distance, but in the ends doubts assailed him and they broke up. Years later and all grown up Jason takes an online pseudonym and with his best friend they initiate a cyber BDSM relationship with Miranda, but before the three of them can meet Miranda is kidnapped. Can the three of them make their relationship work?<br /><br />I found this to be an intense and tricky book to read. While the chemistry and connection between Jason, Miranda and Armand was believable and strong ‚Äì I found quite a few points in the story took me some time to get comfortable with. A lot of the circumstances surrounding Miranda‚Äôs kidnap and abuse was gut-wrenchingly believable. It was far too easy to believe how realistic and simple it would be for this sort of situation to happen literally every day to any woman ‚Äì or young adult/teen. In that sense I found this quite heavy reading and not to my usual taste of romance or erotica. I don‚Äôt mind reading something that is erotically intense or that deals with strong emotion, but serious baggage like abuse and kidnapping are usually subjects I don‚Äôt like to read about in too much depth. I also found it somewhat confusing that Miranda was clearly struggling to deal with some of the facets of her kidnapping and abuse, yet she could simultaneously feel intensely sexual feelings for both Jason ‚Äì whom she tried to convince herself she still hated for breaking up with her when they started college ‚Äì and Armand. The whole hot/cold/hot/cold changeovers from Miranda feeling sexual to recalling various acts of abuse that had occurred when she‚Äôd been kidnapped didn‚Äôt feel very sexy or erotic to me and I struggled to follow with what felt to me like fast changes emotionally in the story.<br /><br />I truly feel the author handled these issues very well. Readers who enjoy deeper, more complex and realistic stories should find this a delight. I feel the subject of Miranda‚Äôs abuse and kidnapping were written respectfully and tastefully (there was no titillation or over-the-top descriptiveness about the actual time she was locked away and hurt/abused) but I did just find it a little too difficult for me to say that I enjoyed or was even comfortable with that aspect of the story and the ramifications that followed.<br /><br />I feel readers should also be aware that while there‚Äôs no heavy or detailed description of it ‚Äì in one scene toward the end of the story Miranda takes another person in a BDSM scene past them using their safe word. While that particular BDSM scene is not really described, refusing to stop when a safeword is spoken is a very strictly held thing in the BDSM scene/lifestyle. I personally found it very difficult to read about her breaking that part of the code of conduct, and especially her rationale and explanation surrounding it just didn‚Äôt patch it up for me, personally. This action of hers very seriously dinted my personal enjoyment of the story as a whole.<br /><br />I did enjoy watching Miranda, Armand and Jason work through their issues, develop their m√©nage relationship and help Miranda heal and come through her trauma. This book has a lot of strong positives, but I just don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs a comfortable or easy read and I absolutely feel this will not suit every reader‚Äôs taste. I could easily see it becoming a ‚Äúlove it or hate it‚Äù style of story as many aspects are polarizing. I believe some readers will love the depth and complexities and the tasteful ways very deep issues are explored ‚Äì others will feel the total opposite.<br /><br />Strongly emotional with quite a few dark pockets this story won‚Äôt be to everyone‚Äôs tastes. That said, the characters are complicated and very interesting, the plot is deep and I feel very well written and the sex is steamy hot.<br /><br />originally posted at long and short reviews",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"Wow.  Excellent Customer Service and Product: I ordered the travel pillow after much extensive research and reading through reviews on various sites, so I was comfortable purchasing Everlasting Comfort's travel pillow.  I was worried on fit or quality of material, which was not a real issue after the product arrived.  The size was great for a 5'10"" person with a slightly thicker neck (the adjustable strings is great).  I noticed that the springs/button for the adjustable neck string was well constructed and easy to customize even while wearing the pillow.  The cover material was soft and removable for cleaning.  And the memory foam felt substantial like sleeping on a cloud.  I was worried that some reviews stated there was some odor, but it was sloght, at most and I just let it air out a day and it was fine.

"This bag is a super cute, high quality case for an small camera: This bag is a super cute, high quality case for an small camera. I love this case and the way it is set up! The front flap has two snap buttons on the back, and a little metal button on the front of the case for easy access to the camera on the inside. I also like how it has a hole on the inside of the case for the lens of the camera, it makes it easier for access. The removable cross body strap can make this case a purse to help your look, or you could just take the strap off and just put the case in your purse. This is awesome as a purse because of the plain, black leatherish color that it has, it looks like a normal purse! Overall I would buy again and I would recommend this to anyone with an instax camera.

"Masterful survey, deeply considered &amp; articulately expressed: I have willfully avoided reading any of Lewis' works because of his popularity.  The mistake and loss were mine, but are mine no more.<br />After an engaging preview in the introduction, the first 132 pages of &quot;The Middle East&quot; is a recap of history, from Nile to Oxus and from AD 1 to 1700 where he highlights precedents for current characteristics.  The Caliphate's expansion was aided by peoples people &quot;long subject to the Persian and Byzantine Empires [who] exchanged one imperial domination for another and found their new masters less demanding, more tolerant, and above all more welcoming than the old.&quot;  The middle third of the book is a collection of cross-sectional essays on the state; the economy; elites; the commonality; religion and law; and culture.  Agriculture &amp; stock raising were economically in different hands, hence the persistence of nomads.  Poets were PR people for rulers, even composing 'jingles.'  Compared to the West, there was a lack of doctrinal differences or strife, an absence of persecution of heretics or unbelievers.  &quot;Muslims... [created] a religious civilization beyond the limits of a single race or religion or culture.  The Islamic world in the High Middle Ages was international, multi-racial, polyethnic. one might even say intercontinental.&quot;  In the 15th and 16th centuries, refugees voted with their feet from West to East.  &quot;[E]ven at the beginning of the 19th century a poor man of humble origin had a better chance of attaining to wealth, power and dignity in the Ottoman Empire than in any of the states of Christian Europe, including post-Revolutionary France.&quot;  The section on religion and law is especially illuminating in its comparison of political law as a supplement to the Shari'a and in its explanation of how custom, regulations, and interpretations were used to disguise new laws.<br />The final part of the book summarizes Middle Eastern history from 1683 to 1994.  The author's analysis of the Ottoman state is the best I've ever seen, from the organizational roots of success, through the seeds of relaxed complacence at the height of its success to its collapse, which he compares and contrasts to the Soviet collapse.  The alienation of landholdings, then governorships, is well covered, as is deindustrialization.  I'll have to get his book on the Ottomans.  Lewis' discussion of patriotism and nationalism is thought-provoking, as is one on the impact of liberty, equality and fraternity.  The last chapter reveals the only significant weakness of the book: Lewis fails to distinguish Modernity  from The West.  He uses the terms modern and West interchangeably, not appreciating a point that Huntington, for one, makes theoretically in &quot;Clash of Civilizations,&quot; and that Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan make in practice.  The author also understates the client-patron nature of the Egyptian, Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Iraqi (formerly), and Saudi regimes, among others.<br />Though there are a couple of spell-check typos (attached instead of attacked, founts instead of fonts),  there are many delights in Lewis' command of language, and not just English.  The depth of his knowledge shines through everywhere.  It may aggravate some, but I especially delighted in his use of 'fora' as plural of the noun 'forum.'  His word choices are true, and his phrasings in places approach the elegance and wry wit of Will and Ariel Durant.  For instance, &quot;even the pettiest of modern dictators has greater control than even the mightiest of Arab caliphs Persian shahs, and Turkish sultans.  The traditional restraints on tyranny have gone.  The search for some new or renewed form of limitation continues.&quot;  The neologismic nature of country names are explored.  He even has a couple of satirical excerpts that had me tearing up with laughter.  And I had to go to the dictionary to look up 'calque' (a copy).  All in all, I found this an informative easily read book that left me wanting more.  It's time to add to my wish list.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Good, for the office: I really wish Kindles were bigger. Although there are pictures they are not real clear on the Kindle. Maybe the pictures should be full page. The book starts out with doing some regular yoga, mat and all, which didn't really match the idea of doing yoga in the office. Well, unless you have a low key boss anyway. Then it moves to chair yoga. Much more practical. And it has the added advantage that it is going to puzzle the people around you. To me it seems like the book assumes that you have some knowledge of yoga to start with, which if you just happened to pick this up to relieve that back pain at the office you probably don't have.  So the book is helpful, but it needs to have full page pictures and a little bit more basic instruction. If you need to do yoga at the office, you need something at the level of &#34;yoga for dummies&#34; instruction.<br />I want to thank the seller for providing this book for free in exchange for an unbiased review.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

I like all of the pre-programmed options available for soup, rice, meat, vegetables, etc. The 6 liter pot is very big, and can easily fit quite a lot of food in it. The unit is also very easy to clean, which is great. I made chicken drumsticks, and a minestrone soup in this unit so far, and they both came out great. The one thing I don't like about this pressure cooker is that the manual is seriously lacking information on exactly how long to cook things. It's really trial and error on the user's part, and some people may find that to be frustrating. I am willing to overlook it, and figure out how to use it myself, as I do like this unit so much.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18
"Great bag and foam but really tight fiting: This product is really good.  I will have to say this if you are playing Tau or Guardsman, this will be the right sided foam for you!  If you are play space marines or anything along those lines, the models fit in there pretty tightly but I was able to get them into the slots.  The foam is really sturdy and nice and the bag is of great quality as well!  Just a heads up on the sizes tho!  Would buy another bag if given the chance!

Highly Recommend: I wanted our family of 4 - two teenagers - to have tea at night - so I bought this.I  use Celestial Seasonings herbal tea bags - I put 2 bags in - brew and have a cup of tea and now the family will go over any time of the night turn it on for a minute and heat it up and we are going through two pots a night. The place where you put your tea is super useful and easy to access and empty. This has been a great way to increase some vitamins and hydration for everyone! Super easy to use and works really well. Highly Recommend this product. Very small footprint.,5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"It's good, but some more customer-friendly rules required: I have used a LaCie 301827U d2 Quadra 1 TB eSATA External Hard Disk before. So, my thoughts immediately went to LaCie 2TB d2 Quadra Hard Disk 301500U when I needed an extra hard drive for my iMac. It has a 32 MB cache much better because my previous one had only 16 MB. Connected it to my iMac with the eSATA card that I purchased and it started up immediately. There's also a USB2 and Firewire 400 / 800.  Can't say it's silent because it does make noise at times.<br /><br />My LaCie really backed up 450 gb of files in nine hours and I have much more space left to store other files. Once I had to report a defect to the LaCie customer support and found out that I have to ship it at my expense. Some customer-friendliness on that count could've been better.",3.0,Electronics,0,12

"A good, somewhat Lamson like Reel: I buy quite a bit of fly fishing gear.  As far as reels, I am pretty much a Lamson fan because I love the conical drag and the quick release.  When this reel came up as a recommendation on Amazon, I noticed that the drag system looked similar to my favorite Lamson drag system.  Where the drag adjustment was I noticed shared a similarity with a Lamson Lightspeed.  In the end, the looks reminded me a bit of a Lamson Liquid.  With the reel being remarkably low, I decided to purchase one.  I was impressed with the quality.  Now, is it the best fly reel I own?  No.  Is it as good as a Lamson?  No.  But the reel's build quality, styling, and drag is better than many much higher priced reels I have used and are on the market.  If this company made a 6 - 8WT reel, I would buy one in a second as a backup reel for my light switch rod setups.",4.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Clean book that's perfect for a middle grade student looking for something to read.: I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Looking for a good book for a middle grade student?  Try Chronicles from Chateau Moines. There isn't any foul language or inappropriate situations, only an innocent kiss at the end. It blends cultures together with anti-war and anti-racism themes. Even when there is conflict within the book, the characters aim to restore the peace.<br /><br />After the death of his mother, Scott Sweet moves to Chateau Moines, France with his sister and father. While there he makes new friends and together they plan a protest for the Vietnam War. Sylvie, on the other hand, has to chose between her friend who likes Scott, or Scott himself. Since it is told through her point of view as well, of course she has to choose the new American boy.<br /><br />Sylvie is my least favorite character in the book. She was very moody for more than half of the book. She kept fighting her crush of Scott because her friend said she liked him first. When she ditched her friend to meet with Scott, I thought she'd loosen up and become less of a stick in the mud. That didn't happen. Even when around Scott, she doesn't try to get very close to him. At times the reminder of him puts her in a bad mood around her friends and family. The only way she opens up about her feelings is through her writing. Throughout the book, readers see the poems/lyrics she writes.<br /><br />Scott, on the other hand, is a bit strong willed--after all he won't wear socks until the war is over. He isn't as moody as Sylvie. He is the peacekeeper in the book. He befriends an Arabian boy, Ibrahim, and tries to be friends with Sylvie--if she will let him. Yes, Scott makes a false assumption in the book, but when he learns the truth, he quickly forgets the grudge he had against a certain adult character. He is a good leader.<br /><br />In the end, the book closes with no loose ends. There is a nice twist that interconnects all of the characters. Astute readers will be able to figure out what this revelation is about half way through the book. It makes for a very happy ending.<br /><br />Since the setting is in France, author Evelyne Holingue incorporates some French language in the book. Most of the French words/phrases are translated. Those that aren't can easily be deciphered with the context clues. This is one aspect of the book I really enjoyed her including. I'm glad the language wasn't all in English.<br /><br />The story is told over the course of a school year in 1970-1971. Historical events are brought up in the book.  Holingue also incorporates music all throughout. Since Scott plays guitar and Sylvie sings, music from the era is cited. Holingue lists the songs at the end of the book along with the album and year published. You'll definitely want to check it out.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Doesn't work on Raleigh Insect Population: I bought this product because I was lead to believe that it would help with the major flea problems in Raleigh, and the recent flea problem in my apartment. After blasting my whole apartment with it and leaving it for at least 4 hours, as directed, I found that there was absolutely no effect. I still gave it a chance, though, because I figured I may have done something wrong, or maybe it really needed to be used multiple times to be effective. So, I went through the whole process again a week later, and there was still no effect. So, I don't know if this stuff isn't what it says it is, if the insects in this area are impervious to its effects and neigh invulnerable, or if there are some other extenuating factors that contribute to its ineffectiveness.<br /><br />On another note, I've attempted to use it on independent insect subjects that crawl through my apartment, such as spiders, cockroaches, and fleas I pull off my cat. I catch the insects, put them in a sealed plastic bag, spray them down with the diatomaceous earth, and leave them in it overnight. When I check after 24 hours, the bugs are still alive and well. Thus, I return to my previous point that I don't know if this stuff isn't what it claims to be, if doesn't actually work at all, if the insects are impervious to it (and other bug treatments, I might add), or if there are some other factors that prevent it from working as expected.",2.0,Industrial_and_Scientific,0,19

Then it turned back to white and became soft and rubbery, like Elmer's glue, losing it's stick to the window sill.  If you use it on an interior area, like molding, where it will never get wet, I think you'll be fine.  But if you use it anywhere it might get wet, you're going to have to rip it out and re-caulk with silicone.  I""m having to do just that.  If I can save you the extra work, I'm happy to help.

"A MUST HAVE SERUM!!!: I have used Sano Naturals Retinol Serum 2.5 nearly three weeks, and I am really impressed with the results. My complexion is glowing, and I have also noticed that my under eye circles are gradually diminishing. Obviously I am doing something right because I have noticed my teenage daughter as well as my husband raiding the bathroom for my clay mask/ apricot scrub etc.  Hence they think this is my secret to my youthful looking skin. Ironically I was out shopping and I mentioned to the cashier that I have three children, and she looked surprised. So I asked how old do you think I am, and she stated, ‚ÄúI thought you were 22‚Äù. I smiled and said that is very flattering, however I am 34!  Ladies before I tried this product I did not think I would get any results because I have tried so many products only to find out that they take months to work, (with minimum results) if they work at all. I am talking about products that cost $30.00-$ 94.00 for 1 ounce. Ironically before I purchased Sano Retinol Serum 2.5 I spent $100.00 on a Lanc√¥me Visionnaire gift set, yet after using the Sano Retinol Serum 2.5 I decided that I will no longer need to spend $100.00 to obtain and keep youthful skin!",5.0,Beauty_and_Personal_Care,1,6

"Funny, Sweet and Unforgettable: It is rumored that some customers enter the Castle Dunes and never, ever leave. That's exactly what sixteen-year-old Donovan has been longing for...a chance to escape his sad, unhappy life. And, he could do it, too, if he could just spend his summer working at the Castle, a haunted-house attraction and hottest spot on the pier.<br /><br />In reality, the Castle has seen better days. It's more rat-infested-crap-shack than palace-of-horrors. Paint is peeling and sets are made of crumbling Styrofoam. Most of the employees are drunk or stoned. Groping the female customers is all in a day's (or evening's) work. Dracula, the King of the Castle, turns out to be a sleazy, dinner theater actor who's a real jerk.<br /><br />But, dreams sometimes do come true, and Donovan gets hired. Though his &#34;dream job&#34; is actually more in the line of cleaning up puke than scaring the bejeezus out of the customers, he doesn't mind.<br /><br />&#34;I took in the view and thought about my new position. I was somebody. I never got a gold star in school, but now I had a pentagram to my name. I thought there was nothing cooler than walking around the empty Castle and helping it work.&#34;<br /><br />As the summer flies by, Donovan makes both friends and enemies and even manages to LEARN SOMETHING! Gasp!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. There was just the right amount of humor mingling with all the teenage angst. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the films 'Adventureland', 'The Way, Way Back', or any other movies that feature teens getting jobs, hanging out with lovable &#34;bad influences,&#34; experimenting with sex, alcohol and/or drugs, finding themselves and maybe even growing up a little bit.<br /><br />Everyone needs a summer like this one...",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

I understand the logic of ordering up but the v-neck/shoulder/armhole area is way too big and the length was super long. In my opinion, I would only order my size (large) or possibly 1 size bigger (XL). I would not suggest ordering two sizes up.

"Quiet, looks nice, gets warm air around the room fast: I've long been a fan of Vornado products for years, so I was excited to give this a try. It's a nice looking heater that's not going to be an eyesore sitting in the corner of a room and it's fairly quiet. The &#34;Vortex Action&#34; is pretty cool and the thing I love most about Vortex products. While I can't verify that it indeed circulates air to every corner of the room (and this will depend heavily on where it's placed), it does seem to get warm air throughout the room fairly quickly and I can feel a gentle breeze from it across the room (~15 feet). It doesn't get hot to the touch and it takes only an inch or two of tilt to trigger the auto-shutoff, so no fear of it getting tipped and becoming a safety issue. Being able to wrap and store the cord underneath the heater is a nice additional feature. My only gripe is that, for the price, I feel that it should have a thermostat on it (something my $25 space heater has), which will cost you an extra $20 for the upgraded model that also has a digital display to let you set the exact temperature you want. Overall, though, it's a nice product.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

The zipper on the compartment seems to be weak, but it was not the main reason I purchased the case.

"The Best Protection For Your Investment...!: I closely examined all the available case options for my new Palm Vx and the Targus Leather Case for the Palm V model is by far the best option! Not only does it enhance the beauty of my new Palm Vx, but the Black Targus Leather Case protects my investment greatly!  The case fits the contour of the Palm Vx and overlaps just enough to protect the Palm Vx from breaking if it is accidentally dropped, unlike 3Com's version.  This case not only does it's job by protecting the Palm Pilot from damage, but the look and feel of the soft, yet sturdy black leather is absolutly beautiful!  I use my Palm Vx and black Targus case as a wallet.  I carry 3 cards, (drivers license, video rental card, and Visa card) the Palm Pilot itself, a few bucks, and perhaps a few business cards.  I don't carry a lot of stuff in it as it's not made to do so.  Yet the Palm Vx and case still remails a thin, compact package!

"Story is still with me after a year: So, I am a procrastinator!  It has been a year since I read A Day at the Fare.  They always say that you will not remember all of the details of an experience but rather how you felt in the moment.  This is so true with this book, although many of the details of Pamela's experiences are very fresh in my mind.  She made me feel as though I was walking through this journey with her. Working in public health for decades but never having to experience the path that Pamela shared-- from making a plan to leave her husband, finding affordable housing, rationing funds every month,  and doing her best to care for her two children, allowed me to open my heart more widely to caring for others.  She took my caring and empathy to a deeper level. That is why even today, a year later, I can still see many of the situations she described in my mind, but I can't remember what I saw on Netflicks last week.  She changed me by using her voice to say, ""These are my truths.  This is what no one shares.""  Thank you for sharing your experiences with me, Pamela so that I can continue to learn and be inspired by our human family.  --Teresa Rugg",5.0,Books,1,7

It was super easy to install and it gets the perfect angle wherever you are sitting in the room. I used this on a 49‚Äù TV. I would definitely recommend this mount. I may even swap out one of the other mounts with another one of these because of its versatility. I am very satisfied with this product!!",5.0,Electronics,1,12

So, I‚Äôm going to let it happen. It‚Äôs too hard not to.‚Äù¬†¬†<br /><br />In this beautiful novella by K. Williams, the reader is reconnected with the characters from All or Nothing. Soobee and Arian are ""The two of us just need to prove ourselves worthy of Carson‚Äôs memory"". And what a beautiful way that they honor Soobee's deceased husband.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novella as well as the other books that are part of the All or Nothing series. As always, K.

"Spellbound: I find myself very excited about Mitzi Tzerman's new book ""Things not Seen"", for I was unable to put her last book down until completed. The beginning of this sequel, ""Things not said"" is book which has very intriguing twists and turns as the suspenseful unfolding of the book evolved. This reader stayed very engaged through the entire book and not only do I  look forward to reading ""Things not Seen"", (which I just received in the mail), but I look forward to reading all of Mrs Tzerman's books. She has a fresh, very descriptive imagination, full of life and suspense. It is a wonderful journey as you jump on the roller coaster ride in the life of her characters. The descriptive realism, implants you right in the middle, as you are eagerly anticipating, and becoming emotionally involved with the characters, as the scenes are played out. Great book.

"First rate serving. Even when cold.: Joe Abercrombie‚Äôs Best Served Cold is even darker and more sinister than the First Law trilogy. But, despite some flaws in the (predictable) plot and in the depth of the characters, not to mention some un-mentionable sex scenes, I enjoyed this single volume well enough to recommend it to readers of the First Law trilogy. The setting is exactly the same as the world in the First Law trilogy, some secondary characters being propelled to the front stage, while other major characters become accessories to the story.<br /><br />Although this will sound paradoxical to any reader of the book, Best Served Cold somehow feels more ‚Äúhomely‚Äù  (than the First Law trilogy) in that the plot follows a single character, Monza, in her senseless quest for revenge. Once again, there is no ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù in the novel and every character enjoys some dark side. Monza builds up a motley group of mercenaries to carry out her revenge and most of them end up in dire circumstances. Once again, Abercrombie is able to forge a very unforgiving universe with characters that are far from flawless but attractive nonetheless. The whole story shows a world on the brink of a barbaric collapse where mercenaries keep switching sides, cities are looted and re-looted, local heads are repeatedly assassinated, and harvests destroyed‚Ä¶ This is definitely a mature book, to keep away from young adults attracted by heroic fantasy. but the unravelling of the story is (mostly) fast paced enough to make reading the book compelling and above all enjoyable. (Okay, I must add that the happy ending could and should have been avoided, but then no major character would have been left alive by the end of the book! And the supernatural natures of the characters Shenkt and Ishri leave a large part unexplained‚Ä¶)",5.0,Books,1,7

"This is a story about finding your port in a storm.: Let me first start by saying Landon is definitely my favorite Downey brother, and this is my favorite book in the series. This is just amazing, it just blows you away and I can't recommend it enough. It's even kind of hard to find the words for this review as nothing seems to be enough for what I want to say.<br /><br />‚ÄúDorothy and the Tin Man,‚Äù<br />‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not that heartless,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not that innocent.‚Äù<br />Landon is emotionally closed-off and a planner who follows reason. Kimber wears her heart on her sleeve and follows her emotions. He doesn't want a relationship because he's never truly had one, and because of something in his past. She doesn't either, but simply because she gets too attached, too quickly, and because there's something in her past as well.<br /><br />Yes, there's instant attraction. In fact, Kimber's attraction for Landon has been there since she was a teenager, but now he's sooo returning it. And what starts as an ""arrangement"", or a list, soon turns into something that neither of them was expecting to find. In the meantime, you'll find a lot of steamy scenes in this book, as you'd imagine from one of Jessica's books.<br /><br />""She was scrappy. He was refined. She was mac-and-cheese-from-a-box. He was Tuna Tartare.""<br />It's lovely to see how their story progresses. How they realize it doesn't matter how you see yourself or where you come from, if you're rich or not doing so well, if you wear designer suits or mended vintage clothes. Life (and love) is so much more than that.<br /><br />""All because‚Ä¶ because she was trying to be someone she wasn‚Äôt. Because she‚Äôd allowed her past to predict her future.""<br />It's kind of hard to let go of your past and to believe whatever happened before won't happen again - because lightning sometimes does strike twice. But once they were able to move past it, to understand what was going on between them, this was all kinds of sweet. And loving. And emotional. And heartbreaking. And yes, happy, finally happy.<br /><br />""He traced the line of her delicate neck to the arms that had once held on to him like he was her port in a storm.""<br />Landon saves Kimber as much as she saves him back. He is her port in a storm, any storm, and he would do anything for her. And she shows him he's not the Tin Man, that his heart is in the right place and that he is deserving of his own port in a storm.<br />And I do believe they can weather out whatever is thrown their way.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"A sweet, charming and emotional romance: Out Of The Gate is a sweet, charming, sexy, and emotional romance of second chances and reconnecting. Although this story is on the shorter side, it flows at a fast pace and packs so much romance and emotion in this thoroughly engaging read.<br /><br />This may be a fast paced read but it hits the spot and did it‚Äôs job in hooking me in. And I was soon captivated by Ada and Dermot‚Äôs romance. I'm not usually the biggest fan of novellas, as the build of the romance happens too fast between the main characters, but with this read everything felt just effortless between the couple and their reconnection was believable. Dermot was the dreamy hero I couldn't get enough of and Ada his perfect match. They had me smiling so big over their endearing relationship. My only complaint is that my greedy reader heart wanted more from these two!<br /><br />For a debut author, Elsie Silver did an amazing job. I loved everything about this story, and I loved getting an introduction to new characters and a prelude to a new series. This quick novella left me with nothing but a huge smile on my face and I‚Äôm looking forward to the next book!",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Wasted Potential: Upon receiving this item, it seemed nice, but not quite as nice as I had hoped. Still, I would say my initial impression was 4 stars. Spade and scoop are both a very reasonable gauge of steel. Rivets and plastic are pretty nice. The spade seems a bit wide for the scoop; it makes it in but a smidge more clearance wouldn't hurt my feelings. The aluminum shafts seem a bit on the flimsy side. All in all, a pretty good product though.<br /><br />So, why only 1 star instead of 4? Well, it broke the second time I used it. I couldn't even tell you how. It seemed fine the first time I used it, but when I went to use it a second time a week later, the adjustable section of the spade was loose, and kept falling down. I tried to tighten it, but to no avail. I'm actually very familiar with the type of mechanism that is inside, as I used to fix trekking poles as part of my job. Its the same concept. This one; however, is just poorly made and unrepairable. So sad to see a good product with real potential fall flat on its face due to a simple issue of cutting corners. For fifty cents more you could have a quality locking mechanism. I would have rather seen a simple straight unadjustable one piece shaft than one that fails so easily. That or use a quality mechanism; I'm willing to pay the difference.",1.0,Pet_Supplies,0,26

"Doesn't everyone believe in magic?: This book hinges on the idea that Marcus loves her because she‚Äôs the only person he‚Äôs ever met who actually believes magic is real. Um‚Ä¶ I believe magic is real. When I see magicians perform, my suspension of disbelief tells me magic is real, unless they go out of their way to show that it‚Äôs actually a trick in front of my eyes. I figured most everyone thinks that way and that it‚Äôs actually the skeptics who look at everything as being an explainable trick who are in the minority, which actually shoots the whole premise of this book. That aside, I loved this book! Marcus is ultimately sexy with his mysterious mask, and love of black leather, and long dark hair. Angela, though very Mary-Sue (which is just one of the pitfalls of a narrating character), still has enough of a history to make her a dimensional character. She has friends, family, two jobs, not much money and what money she has goes to her parents. She‚Äôs struggling to make ends meet and can‚Äôt afford to keep up with her friends (though she can afford an extensive shoe collection). I picked up this book because I love magicians and romance and fantasy and this delivers on all accounts. And the romance is deliciously slow building, and very sexy.

"Tantalising Sci Fi Tapas: 4.5 stars for this gripping first book in the series.<br />I started to browse through the first pages of this book late one night, without knowing anything about it, and found myself reading on‚Ä¶and on‚Ä¶and lo! it was the final sentence. Although short ‚Äì56 pages- there‚Äôs a compulsive feel to the tale, which starts with a bang and continues with a lot more bangs. The only let down I experienced was when it ended, trailing a number of tantalisingly loose ends. Heroine Dorothea, an irresistible blend of vulnerability and kick-ass determination (no whining about broken fingernails from her, she‚Äôs the kind who chews them off and spits them out), was setting off on an adventure that I wanted to know more about; in addition, there were things about her past that had been hinted at, begging for more detail. It felt as though the book was a beautifully rendered vignette; I was keen to see the big frieze.<br />Checking out the book description I discovered the author‚Äôs plan. This was to be a series, with more details emerging in the following books. The different works, the author tells us, are stand-alone, can be read in any order, but ‚Äòthe books fit together like a puzzle‚Äô Aha! So it‚Äôs like a sort of tapas menu. This one was the spicy chorizo, another is the garlic mussels, after that, deep fried squid - each a small self-contained delight, but requiring the full menu to fully appreciate how each part complements the others. Some readers may find this a reason to grumble (cliffhanging?)  but personally I liked the concept. Where else you can get a delicious spicy chorizo appetiser for 0.99 cents?<br />Back to the story. The quality of the writing was remarkably immediate and powerful, plunging us into the heroine‚Äôs disturbing dystopian universe where we shared every sensory aggression  -‚Äòthe undercurrent of old sweat‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äòthe yelling of obscenities‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äòthe piecing wail of the siren‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äòthe gunk and dirt bunched up in the window frames‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äòthe hulking billboards‚Äô‚Ä¶ ‚Äòthe burps of fumes from the bowels of the city‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äòtrash taking flight in the stiff breeze rushing down the alley‚Äô.<br />The characters too are caught in minimalist but telling detail: the ‚Äòfake joy and cheerleader rah-rah‚Äô of Krishna; Dion‚Äôs eyes -‚Äòbrown pools of dangerous lies‚Äô; Darwin‚Äôs ‚Äòice-white skin, hair like distilled sunlight and a lower lip bending like a recurved bow‚Äô. As for the main protagonist, Dorothea, it‚Äôs easy to empathise with her, emerging from prison in her cheap suit with grease stain, hardly able to believe what‚Äôs happening - ‚Äòtension seeping out of me, leaving me exhausted without having done a thing‚Äô, trying to figure out a plan for the future, and coming up against obstructions and setbacks before she‚Äôs even had a chance to enjoy her first burger and beer. The ‚ÄòWaste Management‚Äô chapter was particularly gripping, and her revenge on her tormentors particularly satisfying. Let‚Äôs face it, there are quite simply times when the compassion fatigue sets in and the only response to someone who is trying to drown you in excrement is to deploy your multi-tool‚Ä¶.<br />This is a story that will appeal to sci-fi adventure/action fans who enjoy a touch of black humour to relieve the pressure, as well as readers like myself who, hooked by an engaging heroine facing a world of woe, are ready to step out of their comfort zone, head off into outer space,  and sign up for book 2.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"Android Users Beware!!! WORST Customer Service, plus hacking and compatibility problems.: I bought this in June 2019. Device stopped working five months later. When I reported the problem to FitBit, I was told by FitBit Customer Support that my device and account was hacked through FitBit.  I spent days on the phone and in emails working with customer support to get everything reset and reinstalled, but the device would never sync after the hack. I contacted customer service several times and received generally canned and unhelpful device. I called customer service several times and went through the same run through of restarting my phone, uninstalling an reinstalling the app, etc. After two months of the device not working (and merely eight months old), I finally pushed on customer service and refused to hang up without an answer. First, they gave me some ridiculous suggestions - like that I should link the device to someone else's phone! (Why would I want that??) i refused to give in because, at that point, I had wasted hours and hours on this, not to mention the money. Finally, they told me for the first time the device wouldn't work on my version of Android, specifically listing out that every phone I had tried (and failed) to sync the device on post-hacking had ""incongruities."" This is false according to the product ad, which says it is compatible with Android 5.0 and up. I pointed this out, so they tried to set it up on my laptop, which also failed. Only then, only after two months of having a device that got hacked THROUGH FitBit, did they concede to replace it. To add insult to injury, they told me I have to pay shipping to return it. I honestly don't even want the replacement at this point. I've wasted so much time and energy on a defunct watch that doesn't so much as even tell the correct time!<br />In sum, this is product is not secure, is likely incompatible with Android, and customer service is terrible.<br /><br />UPDATE: I returned my unusable, unsyncing watch on February 14, 2020. For over two weeks, I heard crickets. I was supposed to receive my watch after five days, so I started reaching out again. I followed up on the tracking, re-contacted the email sending me the replacement form, and escalated my issue with customer service. Crickets. Eventually, on the 28th (again taking time out of my workday), I called and was placed with a customer service agent who was bewildered about where my replacement had gone, only to discover it was never sent. I received the replacement watch 3 months and 3 days after Fitbit was hacked and it stopped working. Worst part is- it isn't even the watch I bought. It's a bigger, bulkier version that looks just terrible on my tiny wrists. To add insult to injury, they told me to return my charging cable, and the one they replaced it with has no wall plug, which means I'm chained to a computer if I want to charge it. I don't own a home computer.<br /><br />I could not recommend FitBit or their products less.

"A review from inside: The following excerpts are from a review posted at charlesapril.com by Gabriel Schechter:<br />Of the Hall of Fame's three missions--""preserving history, honoring greatness, connecting generations""--the last has always seemed the most important to me. When I worked at the Hall of Fame's library from 2002-2010, my own mission focused on helping visitors, many of whom regarded their visit to Cooperstown as a once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage to baseball's mecca, celebrate their own connections to the sport. . .I know of no single object that represents the joys of baseball connection more than The Hall Ball, so designated by Ralph Carhart and celebrated in his book of the same title.  Do yourself a favor and share in Carhart's extraordinary quest to use one object--a used baseball his wife, Anna, spotted in the creek that runs past Doubleday Field during their own 2010 pilgrimage to Cooperstown--to unite all of the members of the Hall of Fame. What did Ralph Carhart do? The book's subtitle is apt: ""One Fan's Journey to Unite Cooperstown Immortals with a Single Baseball."" He set out to photograph that baseball, with THE HALL BALL its lone adornment, in the hands of every living Hall of Famer and at the gravesite of every deceased one. This eight-year quest ultimately saw him seek out and immortalize all but a handful of the 323 Hall of Famers when he turned in 2018 from the quest to chronicling it in this terrific book. . .How many baseball fans would go to that much trouble to make such meaningful connections with people he could never know? Ralph Carhart did it, and he tells the story in a book that abounds with neat details that make his journey seem both intensely personal and ultimately universal. He takes us along with him all the way, as the thing takes on a life of its own, a wide-open daydream at the start, hardened by travel and other difficulties and fueled by epiphanies and endless connections, eventually dwindling down to the end of the list (except for just a handful of White Whales). . .Whether Carhart got what he wanted in a few minutes or it took hours, we know how he felt about it. I knew nothing about The Hall Ball before this year, but now I feel like I've known Ralph and Anna Carhart for a long time, and that is a decidedly good thing. You'll be glad to share in their travels as they prove once again that in a long trip toward a distant goal, what you experience along the way is far more vivid and rewarding than what awaits you at the end. Fittingly, what Carhart expected to happen to The Hall Ball did not happen, and The Hall Ball ends with that artifact headed for a place that seems just as perfect as its journey.<br /><br />That's all, and it's still just a portion of the review. You should read it too!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />GS",5.0,Books,1,7

"Shorts and several items in the Deacon universe: *Book source ~ A review copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />This is a collection of stories and things from the Deacon Chalk universe. Not all are typical short stories. Some are things that can be found on various blogs and some are just odds and ends pertaining to a series.<br /><br />Dolly ~ This I love. A look at Deacon a year before Blood and Bullets and how he came to acquire Polecats. Also, why haven‚Äôt we seen more of Bicuspid? I‚Äôd love to see more of him.<br /><br />Blood and Bullets trailer script ~ This isn‚Äôt something I enjoy reading. Scripts kinda bore me and while I don‚Äôt watch book trailers other people do, so this would probably be a good book trailer.<br /><br />Father Mulcahy and Kat interview ~ Some blogs like to interview book characters and this is one of those types of interviews. I don‚Äôt do these and I don‚Äôt read them either though I know plenty of people who love this kind of interview.<br /><br />Meta ~ The author and his character having coffee and chit chatting. It‚Äôs hard to wrap my brain around it, but it‚Äôs not bad.<br /><br />Recipe for an Occult Bounty Hunter ~ Another odd creative thing that some blogs do and this wasn‚Äôt too bad.<br /><br />Interview with Charlotte Vale ~ This is another blog special interview with a character.<br /><br />Tiff‚Äôs First Day ~ This is a short story told from Tiff‚Äôs POV.<br /><br />The Man for the Job ~ A blog question that James Tuck answers.<br /><br />O.C.I.D. Interview with Charlotte Vale ~ A blog interview that has one character questioning another. Btw, I like Special Agent Heck. I hope he sticks around.<br /><br />The Ravenous ~ This is a short story, kinda. It introduces a new character to the Deacon series, but it doesn‚Äôt really have a satisfactory beginning. I am looking forward to seeing more of Phoebe Fluffenstuff, Were-Pomeranian though I hope we get more of a beginning for her. I want to know how she got where she is now and how Fenrir fits into it all.<br /><br />Twas the Fright Before Christmas ~ A short Christmas story that shows Deacon is always on the job, holiday or not.<br /><br />Shop Til You Drop ~ Another holiday short only this one deals with Deacon. At a mall. On Black Friday. Ha!<br /><br />Nature Trail to Hell ~ A decent short that puts Deacon out in the woods trying to find some missing Royal Rangers (think Boy Scouts) and their leader and figuring out what of kind of monster he‚Äôs hunting.<br /><br />Blood and Magick Alternate ~ No. I prefer what ended up in the book.<br /><br />Second Chapter Fresh Ink ~ Another story with the author and Deacon interacting. Not bad if weird.<br /><br />First Look at Silk and Scale ~ A peek at the next book. Can‚Äôt.Wait!",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"This is the only airbrush you'll ever need.: Pros:<br />- Good quality<br />- Durable<br />- Versatile - fine detail to wide strokes<br />- Easy to clean<br />- Can last several years without any issues or maintenance other than cleaning<br />- Made in the USA<br /><br />Cons:<br />- An airbrush consists of delicate, precision parts. So when you need to let's say replace a needle you have to keep in mind that you cannot just replace it. You have to make sure the needle you are replacing is the right size for the tip and airhead you are using.  Keep that in mind before replacing anything. The parts are not marked, so the only way to tell from one another is the size, and the size difference for the needles and air holes for each tip are minuscule. I recommend keeping each part labeled properly. I have ruined airbrushes by mixing parts.<br /><br />Additional comments:<br />I have read other posts of people having issues and called Paasche's customer support with a very positive outcome. The majority I've heard they got a new replacement. In my case, I don't run into any issues for several years  before I have to replace the airheads, tip and needle. In reality I am my wife's repair guy my wife uses airbrushes on a daily basis for decorating cakes.  So believe me, I forget how all those tiny parts go together after a couple of years of not touching an airbrush, so I make sure I label everything.<br /><br />Tips:<br />- Buy a cleaning kit and cleaning liquid at a reputable airbrush dealer. It's essential to preserve your airbrush in top shape. Clean your airbrush after each use with the cleaning liquid. Cleaning tools such as brushes and pokers can be used for tough spots to clean or clogged orifices.<br />- I repeat, label your spare parts.<br />- Use of a dedicated airbrush brush for a specific setting is a time saver, that way you don't have to switch parts  when you need to switch from wide stroke to detail; all you need is switch airbrushes.<br />- Get quick release valve connectors to quickly switch the air hose to other airbrushes.",5.0,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,1,3

"Out of Step: I got this book solely out of curiosity why it lingered so long on the Vine leftover list. In fact, I was so tired of looking at the cover I took it to help get it off the available list. With books published by AmazonCrossing, my results have been mixed but I have discovered works translated by the original authors have tended to flow much more fluidly than in those instances where another individual has taken on the task.<br /><br />While falling well short of enthralling, after reading the first chapter where the description of the level of commitment, dedication, perseverance, pain and arrogance the major character had to have or endure to get a plumb internship was discussed, I was sufficiently intrigued to want to discover what alchemy this mysterious tango dancer had concocted to mesmerize this young woman.<br /><br />With only a few mouse clicks, it was easy to determine the book in its' original German, was titled, ""Three Minutes with Reality.""  The decision to re-title and re-position as a mystery thriller rather focusing on the romance or even literary genres may have been a misapplication. It seems contradictory to acclaim a book is well written when one finds so many aspects unappealing.  As a mystery the book is excruciating and boring but when viewed from another perspective, it is easily seen as provocative, seductive and meticulously constructed. Any mystery elements here will probably dissipate for most readers as soon as basic background information about Damien Alsina, the tango dancing love interest of ballerina Guiletta Battin, is reached in the text.<br /><br />Fleshhauer seems derisive of his major character. She is portrayed as a jejune, frivolous and petulant little brat with an image of self as irresistible to any sentient male (and conceivably female). She is too flawed to muster any level of identification with or evoke empathic feelings from the reader, yet the author's pedagogical studies of ballet, tango, Argentinian culture and history tend to keep the book interesting enough so long as one is not disenchanted with the absence of any genuinely engrossing mystery element.  He artfully sculpts images of the characters and their features, creates lucid visualizations of the dance movements and the juxtaposition of tango and ballet.<br /><br />I would enthusiastically read other works from this author as he is clearly talented. However, based on marketing focus, this book may not represent his best work.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Love Sexy Sawyer and Cupcake: 4.5 stars. I didn't think I could like Grace and Sawyer's story more than Julia and Jaxson's, but I did. For starters, Grace has endured a lot of unhappiness and loneliness. It's heartbreaking to read about everything she has had to experience starting from her mother's tragic death. Yet she still keeps a somewhat positive attitude and works hard everyday. She has a heart of gold and is an amazing baker. Sawyer may be cocky and arrogant, but around Grace, he can be protective and caring and sweet. Jaxson was the same way with Julia except he pissed me off with how he wanted to deny loving Julia and will always have lost points for that even though he made it up to her. This is where Sawyer doesn't disappoint and steps up like a man. He isn't perfect, but he knows Grace is broken and he has no intention of making it worse, he does whatever he can to make her laugh and smile. The side of Sawyer that adores Grace can be jealous and scary, too, like Jaxson's level of scary and threatening, if his girl is in danger or threatened. Sawyer and Jaxson's banter was hilarious because Sawyer comes off way more alpha in this book than the previous one, pretty much meeting Jaxson toe to toe. Kayla is her usual smart mouth self and Cooper is still trying to maintain order within the law even though he has temperamental Navy SEAL friends who try to skirt the fine line of the law because they care so much about justice. Anna is also present in the book briefly and I loved the big brother and little sister relationship she has with Jaxson, Sawyer and Cade. I was just happy to see Grace happy with an ending that included Sawyer and so much more. Can't wait for Cade's story because he really needs to smile more.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Pretty Squishy....: I bought this topper because it was semi-affordable and 3"" which was better than the 2"" maximum that seems more popular. I purchased because of back pain. My current mattress is too hard and my hips dig into it. I did try a 2"" waffle foam topper but it just crushed down to nothing and really didn't offer any cushion so I tried this 3"" topper in addition to the 2"" topper (so 5"" of foam). This stuff is a bit firmer than the super cheap memory foam but it's still way too collapsible to offer much cushion under the heavier parts of your body (ie: your torso). If you want support/cushion for your limbs or just need mild cushion for the rest of you, then this topper will do that trick. I unfortunately can still feel the mattress with my hips once my weight has squished the foam down (and I'm an average sized girl). That's probably more of a personal problem than necessarily a problem with the topper itself tho, I suppose. :)<br /><br />I noticed in some reviews that people complained about the topper moving. I have not noticed any of that. The topper has stayed in place, tho I am careful to avoid dragging myself off the bed which would definitely disturb it. You can also get textured mattress covers for your mattress (anything but slippery silk, honestly) so the topper has enough friction to stay in place. I also use a fitted sheet on top of everything, of course. I have a normal fitted sheet but a deep fitted sheet would work too.<br /><br />Some other reviewers complained about the topper breaking down but I've not noticed that yet and I've been using it since the end of June daily...",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

I have played in cold conditions with snow on the ground and really really hot conditions as well and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with fogging yet! However, I will say that I live in a very dry environment, so I don‚Äôt know how they would perform in a more humid area like the south.<br /><br />Overall, these goggles are cheaper than the other options out there and they are way better quality, they are comfortable, and they don‚Äôt fog!!!

"Love! Love! Love!: I have this one in Black...<br /><br />I just replaced a 15 year old Maytag that had been used approximately 6500 times with this one. My family loves to cook and uses a lot of dishes! (The dial controller degraded to only working on the glassware / china setting, but still worked.) I loved my old Maytag and wanted exactly the same features (steam clean, sanitizing cycle, heated drying, and high-endurance motor). BTW, I attribute the fact that it lasted so long to good quality workmanship and the fact that we never used any drying agents - all we did was put the detergent in and run it. And, this purchase was like going from an old reliable but clunky car to an updated zippier sports car. I opted for the stainless steel interior because what I noticed over time was the plastic interior (on the old one) seemed to get gouged and scratched and retained a slight odor. (We always prewash the dishes so that the disposal never really got clogged or anything). The control pad on the edge does take getting familiar with; it is not a deal breaker. It is super quiet, although the water intake is a little noisy and unnerving - it sounds like water is gushing all over the floor. It doesn't leak (like some people claim), and, the installation team did an EXCELLENT job. Finally, I love the new layout for the dishes and the little baskets. Again, it takes some getting used to - but all in all it's been sweet so far. Shop around because most stores will match competitors.",5.0,Appliances,1,2

"The Secura Automatic Electric Milk Frother and Warmer is very easy to use: I purchased this as a birthday gift for my husband after our Starbucks frother stopped working.<br /><br />The Secura Automatic Electric Milk Frother and Warmer is very easy to use, easy enough for the kids to make their own hot chocolate.<br />We only received it on the 1st (Surprise! ETA was the 2nd), so I will say that so far so good.<br />We have found that using the wire whip for frothing, creates too much foam for us. We prefer the &#34;Stir&#34; attachment, it makes the perfect amount of foam. However...in the summer when we make Macchiatos, the extra foam may be perfect.<br />I too, love the removable stainless steel cup (I think my husband submerged the Starbucks frother on accident). This unit holds twice the milk as the Starbucks unit, the operative word is MILK. The directions for this unit says to use only milk. With the Starbucks unit, you can use milk alternatives. I have dairy allergies so I have to use milk alternatives. I am only giving it four stars because of this.

Great Recent Santana Live Performance: This is a beautifully shot Blu-ray with great sound quality and is a very long recent (2011) concert by Santana and his band.  The music covers his career.

During the performance Santana brings up a young boy from the crowd while he is playing!  His sentiments about peace and harmony in the world voiced during the concert just add to his music.

"A surprising find: I am a professional musician and ukulele is one of the main 3 instruments I play for my job. This banjolele was purchased as a gift for my daughter (whom is also a gigging musician) but of course I had to set it up, attach the pick-up, tune, stretch, etc. I am quite literally shocked at the quality of this instrument. I have a higher-priced banjolele myself... as well as quite the collection of mid-to-high end ukuleles, guitars and basses. This thing sits well amongst them. The Velcro sent to attach the input jack is flimsy and I discarded it for a more solprice point. (The reason for the 4 stars)... but other than that I (and my daughter) have zero complaints. It sounds beautiful and is seemingly well made. No burrs on the frets, quite comfortable to play. Now to be very fair... this banjolele has only been with us a very short while- so I cannot speak to the longevity of the instrument. However I get the impression that if it's well looked after that it will last many years of live shows. The pick-up is great for live performance but if you're planning on recording with it I would use a microphone or install a better pick-up. If you're looking for a performer for shows or just something to pluck on in the down time of your life... this little guy is great for both. Especially at this pricepoint. Well worth it.",4.0,Musical_Instruments,1,23

"Death in a bag. Don't buy if you love your pet!!!!!: I recently (trustingly) purchased ""Canyon Creek Ranch"" brand ""Duck Tenders"" from a Petco store in Nampa, Idaho. I have been purchasing products from Petco stores for my Yorkshire Terrier since we got her as a puppy a year ago.  I dearly love my Yorkie and thought that this would be a nice treat for her training needs. I purchased a bag and began ""rewarding"" her with a jerky treat about once a day (instructions tell me that I can give more, but one is enough). As I write this, my precious Yorkie, Makena, is on her 2nd day of treatment to try to bring her out of renal failure directly caused by these ""treats"". Are you aware that the FDA has posted a warning with regards to this very brand of treat and that currently over 360 deaths have occurred and more than 2200 other pets have fallen ill as a direct result of this company's product? I implore  you to stop the sales of this product to your customers. If you really are a business that truly cares about pets, please stop. Losing a pet like Makena is so very hard. It is just like losing a member of the family. I am telling every pet owner I know about this. I understand business. I understand that you don't wish to lose profit. I also hope that you understand that selling products that are harmful is bad business. Please do the right thing and pull all products that have been purchased from Chinese mills. My veterinarian has stated, and the FDA articles back this up, that pretty much ""all pet food products from China should be avoided"".<br />[...]",1.0,Unknown,0,32

"Great for General Crafting: I usually order a new set of markers each year, since I do a fair amount of crafting, lettering, and signage for the non-profit for whom I volunteer.  I decided to give these Warmsun Markers a try.  There are 35 colors from one end of the spectrum to the other, but there are quite a few of the darker colors, which is nice, since most marker sets don't have those.  They came packaged in a plastic case, that snaps closed.  I also liked that the markers are not wedged into the case, making it much easier to get them in and out.<br />  The markers themselves have a thin end and a very, very fine end - great for lettering!  There is also a small package within the plastic package which contains 2 replacement nibs for the fine end, with instructions.  Nice touch!  The markers are advertised for coloring books. I don't plan to use them that way, but just for fun, tried them on a coloring book.  The colors bled right through the page!

"Love & Hate: I received the Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote about a week ago. I was VERY excited to get it! Set up had a few steps, but didn't take long at all. I got things up in running and at first was thoroughly impressed with how well everything was working and how fluid everything was running. I felt the Fire Stick after watching Netflix on it for a few hours and the stick itself was warmer than I had anticipated. For that reason, I wish there were an on/off switch on the stick itself so that I didn't feel as though I shouldn't leave the house without unplugging it.<br /><br /> The last couple of times that I was watching something on the Fire Stick, the visual was lost but the sound continued, which is actually very frustrating since it has always seemed to happen at climax moments in the show/movie I was watching. The only way I have found to get the visual back was by unplugging the stick for a little while. After doing so it takes a few minutes again before everything is up and running as it should be.  I fear this may be a sign as to what the future holds with this thing. I surely hope that I didn't waste a bunch of money!!!",3.0,Electronics,0,12

"Which I Could Say it Sucks . . . But it Doesn't: PRO's: (a) Lasted a full 6 months, (b) the power cord the comes with it can be easily removed and used for other purposes, and (c) good vacuum as long as nothing ever clogs it up.  At that point, you'll need a repair shop or just toss it in the garbage.<br /><br />CON's: (a) Non-standard screw heads in hard-to-reach places (deep and narrow) and installed VERY tightly make it more than difficult to disassemble and clean out.  It's clearly designed to NOT be conveniently worked on by the user. (b) Rubber gasket that covers the gap between the top and bottom pieces malforms easily leading to loss of suction.<br /><br />By there very nature Vacuum cleaners get dirty and need to be cleaned.  This is a good vacuum until you need to remove something that got stuck in side.  In summary . . . WAY to hard to work on and worst Oreck (although most expensive) I've ever purchased.

"What a ride!: I was emailed by author, Lee Matthew Goldberg, asking to read and review his latest novel. To be honest, I was on the fence at first. Not because it didn't sound intriguing but because I was busy in my personal life and just wasn't sure I could commit to reading it before publication. Well, a couple weeks later my life had an opening and time to read was abundant, so I decided to read and review. I was so glad I opened this epub file!<br /><br />First, I want to point out that I was a teen in the 90s, so this brought back the nostalgia immediately. The complete immersion into the 90s grunge scene was something I didn't even know I needed. The fact that the main character is female and the author is male I an amazement I want to highlight. Lee Matthew Goldberg has done a FANTASTIC job building this main character. Every feeling I had as a teenage girl in the 90s was reflected in this story. I loved this book more than I thought I would.<br /><br />Nico is a teenage girl surrounded by grief and confusion. Her older sister died suddenly of a brain aneurism and her parents are getting divorced. The friends she keeps aren't the best influences and Nico finds her life spiraling. Convinced she will meet the same horrible fate as her sister soon, she sets off on a solo road trip to check off items on her bucket list.  Her adventures on the road from L.A. to Seattle fill the pages with witty humor, bad decisions and self discovery.<br /><br />Character development throughout was superb and the scenes described were detailed. I had no issues immersing myself in Nico's journey. The 90s references were spot on!<br /><br />I highly recommend this well written coming of age novel for anyone and want to thank author Lee Matthew Robert for the chance to read and give my honest review! It was a 5 star read for me!<br /><br />I finished this book a couple weeks ago and segments of the story still pop into my head from time to time. It was that good. I see on Goodreads it is listed as the first in a series, so if that is true, I am excited to read the next instalment in Nico's life journey.<br /><br />Happy reading!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"One of my favorite films of all time: I was introduced to this film as a small child by my father. It quickly became one of my favorite films. I have seen it countless times and it continues to make me laugh despite the fact that I know all the lines. The witty banter and physical comedy are comparable to some of the best. In addition, The primary and supporting cast all give spectacular performances. As a rule I dislike ""RomCom"" as a genre but Preston Sturgiss takes this film out of that genre and into that of witty & intelligent films which also use every tool possible (including but not limited to: camera direction, sets, costumes, etc.) to make it an enjoyable movie for all ages and all genders regardless of any other preferences the viewer may have. I've seen many people who don't usually enjoy black and white films will find themselves laughing and enjoying themselves tremendously throughout the film. I would suggest this film to anyone and everyone who wants an enjoyable film to watch. Some of the outfits are dated due to the time period so the hats and dresses can be a bit extreme but this was high fashion for the time period. Like most art, I think it should be viewed in the comparison with other films being made at that time but like really good art, it stands the test of time without question.",5.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Surprisingly impressed: At first I was disappointed in this as using my standard print settings I quickly got a jam.  I ended up increasing temps to 220 and actually swapped over a .5 from .4 nozzle to try to reduce the chances of a jam.  With everything else the same (including print speed) I was able to successfully print a bashguard/chainguide for ISCG05 mounts that I have successfully printed many times in PLA+.<br /><br />I was skeptical about the physical characteristics of this and thought it was likely just marketing however there is absolutely a difference in the material and characteristics compared to my go to PLA+ (Esun & GST3D).  I did a test print a strip about 10mm wide, and 4mm thick.  I then tried to break this by snapping it in half and was very surprised when it didn't snap as expected.  It bent but did not snap and even when I bent it back and forth multiple times I could not get the piece of separate at the bend point.  I think this is really great for applications that might take an impact or be under some stress as it appears you won't have a catastrophic failure like I've experienced with PLA+.  I realize PLA+ is not the best material for impact resistance but I don't want to print in ABS with the fumes and climate issues although I suppose PETG might be a better solution.<br /><br />This Carbon infused PLA for $28 really blew me away.  I'm definitely ordering another pool for more of my function prints that need to have some strength and resistance to snapping!",5.0,Industrial_and_Scientific,1,19

"Mostly good, but flawed for girls: My three and a half year old daughter really enjoys this book. It's written in a style that's entertaining and easy to understand. I like that the authors have included many types of families in the illustrations, and have tried to combat gender stereotypes by discussing all of the similarities about what boys and girls like (both boys and girls like active play; both boys and girls play with dolls). However, there is one flaw in the book that bothers me as I read it to my little girl. In the descriptions of the external physical attributes of boys and girls, boys' external genitalia is named, while girls' is not. Boys are described as having ""a penis, a scrotum, and two openings."" Girls, on the other hand, are described as having merely ""three openings."" And while there are indeed a penis and scrotum visible in the picture accompanying the boy's description, in the girl's, the little girl resembles a Barbie doll with a smooth genital area and three dots representing her openings. The little girl has no clitoris at all, and just a hint of labial folds. I understand that a clitoris may have been a little tougher to draw than a penis, but to completely excise a part of female genitalia in a book about the topic? What is a little girl supposed to think about that part of her anatomy? According to this book, it shouldn't exist and doesn't have a name. But if you have a daughter, you know that she knows it's there. The first time we read this book, my daughter was confused and wondered if she had a penis, because she said she had a ""bump like that"" and pointed to the picture of the little boy's genitals.<br /><br />Since my daughter still likes to read this book, and since I do like the rest of it, I choose to just add in the words when I read it to her. I read that sentence as ""Between their legs, girls, baby girls, and women have a clitoris, a vulva and three openings."" I point to the picture and say ""her clitoris is here, just above the opening where the pee comes out"" (which is how the urethral opening is described in the book). It's not a perfect solution, and while I understand the authors' intent to rely on very simple descriptions, it would be great to know the reasoning behind completely omitting a visible part of a girl's body. We're already so squeamish about girls' genitals, calling their genitalia their flower, their bits, their woo-woo... is it too much to ask that in a book about their bodies, visible female parts should be represented and named?",3.0,Books,0,7

"Great performances: Clockers is a good 1995 film with great acting and cinematography. It stars Mekhi Phifer in his screen debut with a strong supporting cast including Delroy Lindo, Harvey Keitel, John Turturro, Regina Taylor, Pee Wee Love, and Michael Imperioli. The term ""clockers"" refers to  inner city meth sellers who work around the clock.<br /><br />The film is based on a 1995 novel of the same name  by Richard Price.<br /><br />In a film with so many excellent performances, 21 year old newcomer Mekhi Phifer stands out. He went on to appear in more than 20 films including ""8 Mile"" (2002), ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004), and ""Slow Burn"" (2005). As well, he has been in several TV movies and a regular in series like ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"","" ER"" and ""Lie to Me"".<br /><br />Harvey Keitel is probably one of the finest actors still working. He was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his role in ""Bugsy"" (1991), but the fact is he has sooo many great performances (e.g., ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Mean Streets"" ""Pulp Fiction"",  ""Smoke"" and especially ""Bad Lieutenant""). His performance in this film is one of his better jobs, which is saying a lot.<br /><br />John Turturro is another one of the best actors in the business today. His quirky appearance and physical mannerisms have adorned more than 50 films, the most notable of which include ""Quiz Show"" (1994), ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" (2000), and ""Barton Fink"" (1991). In addition he won an Emmy for his appearance in an episode of ""Monk"" in 2002. Unfortunately we get far too little of Turtorro in this film.<br /><br />The story, per se, is not as complex as you might imagine, but spotty direction by Spike Lee makes it more difficult to follow than it need be. In addition, there are several B and C plots that are left unresolved, which isn't a federal offense, but ...<br /><br />Spike Lee is a well known director of black films that focus on urban problems. His break out film, ""Do The Right Thing"" (1989), was his seventh film and he was Oscar nominated for that film. He also won an Emmy in 2007 for ""When the Levees Broke"". ""Clockers"" was originally slated to be directed by Martin Scorsese, who chose instead to direct ""Casino"".<br /><br />If the direction is less than stellar, the cinematography certainly is not. Malik Hassan Sayeed does a great job in his filming debut. He's continued to work with director Spike Lee (""He Got Game"", ""The Original Kings of Comedy"") and has an active career in TV commercials as well.<br /><br />Terrance Blanchard provides an exciting musical score. Blanchard is a 5 time Grammy winner (out of 12 nominations) and scored more than 20 films including ""Jungle Fever"" (1991), ""Summer of Sam"" (1999), and ""Barbershop"" (2002). He scores all of Lee's films.<br /><br />This is a very good film and deserves to be seen. More than almost any other film it provides an excellent insight into the problem of meth/crack and its impact on inner city people.",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Highly recommend, easy to use, extremely well built, but the dust collection is just about useless.: This little palm sander actually isn‚Äôt so little. Kinda like cars do these days, palm sanders seem to get bigger with each revision. It‚Äôs fits my hand fine, but I have huge hands and I can't help but think it might get tiring for someone with normal or small hands.<br />  The build quality is excellent. I‚Äôve had other sanders where the unit is let down by little things like the sandpaper retention clips being pathetic, or little, important, bits of plastic snapping off making the whole unit completely useless. I don‚Äôt get the feeling that this will happen with this dewalt unit.<br /> The power it excellent. Plenty to help make your project move along faster.<br /><br />Cons - The dust collection isn‚Äôt great. It does collect dust, but honestly it‚Äôs probably less than 1/10 of what produced, even with the correct grated paper or holes punched in regular sandpaper. I work on interior finishes in construction, and dust prevention is very important these days. For a unit of this price, this should be better.<br />  Size, bigger isn‚Äôt always better. Palm sanders are supposed to be able to be used for detailing and getting into areas that normal rotary or belt sander can‚Äôt. They‚Äôre lightweight versatile, able to be used in places you couldn‚Äôt get anything else, etc. While this isn‚Äôt exactly heavy, it‚Äôs well over 5‚Äù tall and for want of a better analogy, it needs to go on a diet as it‚Äôs quite chunky. Having said that, just about all palm sanders are this size right now.<br /><br />I bought this to do a little finish on a new deck, and it‚Äôs honestly doing a great job. It took me about 15 minutes to sand and finish 45ft of 6‚Äù cedar hand rail cocktail cap using 3 different grits of paper throughout.<br /><br />Pay a little more for the better quality.<br /><br />Highly recommended!",4.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"Won't fit MOST chairs: Note that this is sized smaller than a US standard directors chair. If yours was mass produced in or for the states these won't fit. If in doubt, measure your chairs.<br /><br />The directors chairs I own was homemade and on the smaller side so this did fit. I was very excited cause most are too big and sag.<br /><br />Unfortunately while they worked for a bit, the stiching did not hold up long at all, only a couple of weeks of regular use and it started to tear. I use my directors chair regularly but not constantly, and only weigh around 150 lbs [~70 kg] so that should give an idea of how poor the material is.<br /><br />These must be intended for a childs directors chair.

"Greek Grotesqueries: This is the second full-lenghth from Greece's Burial Hordes (cool name, huh?), and while I would give their debut 5 stars, I say only 4.5 for this one.  4 is actually too low.  While the first was almost non-stop machine-gunnery of Black MeTal punishment, this one has a few slower and more repetetive sections.  There is also a seeming degradation in production and musicianship on ""Devotion...""  but once I describe the sound of the band, you will see that this isn't much of a concern!  Their sound is like an amalgamation of the most ancient Mayhem, ancient Marduk, and ancient Celtic Frost, with some ancient Sex Pistols thrown in there for an out-of-control punk feeling.  The general intent of the music is a holocaust of speed, but main riffs suddenly give way to slow, menacing passages or unexpected surprises which are hithertofore unheard of by myself.  It makes for a very VERY interesting listen, though I found their debut to be more interesting slightly.  The vocals are more of a raspy type than the shrieking type, but there is a great variety of tormented howls from the vocalist (the only members' names I recall at this time are Impaler on drums and the amusingly named Necrotormentor on guitars and bass.....though he's shortened it to just ""Necro"" under his current photo, my fiends and I have often wondered how long it took him to come up with that pithy pseudonym!).  The guitar riffs vary from standard to ""whoah, how did they come up with THAT!?"" oddly alien and disjointed tones that do not approach the pretentiousness of ""prog"" wankery, again a lot of variety.  The drums rip along like a Panzer, as you'd expect and not be disappointed.  Bass?  Who ever notices bass in Black MeTal!  However, it is audible...in fact, the whole sound of the album is rather ""low"", as opposed to the shrill treble of much Black MeTal.  Not to say that it is obscured or murky; everything is audible, but kind've sounds like it was recorded somehow in the damp stone confines of a dark tomb.  Ain't nothin' wrong with THAT!  The musicianship is, like on their debut, approaching ""punk"" in how it seems to sometimes get ahead of itself...though it never falls apart, there is something very refreshing about this style of playing, akin to mistaking an industrial-size meat grinder for your favourite hat: violently brutal yet unexpected and enjoyable!  The lyrics are very over-the-top(in fact, tediously so, but there is perhaps the language barrier to consider) involving blasphemy, war, and a ""goatfeast"".  But they are relentlessly grim, despite their redundancy.  I got the digipak version, which has a keen layout and full lyric booklet with photos.  I notice that the price here on Amazon is ridiculously low; snap it up before it becomes ""kvlt"" and the price goes way up!",4.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Exorbitant ink cartridge prices!!!: I bought this printer on sale at Costco for $99. It works well, except the black copies are not very black...more grayscale. I think the cartridges that came with the printer may be drying out. Haven't tried color printing yet. The main problem, though, is that when I went to buy a bundle of the four cartridges that this printer requires, I discovered that the bundle with XL capacity for the black cartridge costs $107!!! Yes, just to buy one replacement for the four ink cartridges costs more than the printer itself! I am trying to decide what to do...will probably return the printer within the 30 day return window and buy another printer, maybe a laser. To add insult to injury, the box that the printer came in claimed that with this printer, you would get laser quality printing at half the cost. This is certainly a lie and false advertising. Epson appears to be a dishonest company that is fleecing its customers with disgracefully high ink cartridge prices. I think I will support another company.",1.0,Office_Products,0,24
"Wonderful story, great characters!!: What a wonderfully written book with a storyline that captures you from the beginning and holds you captive till the very end. A story about childhood friends, first loves, secrets and fears. The characters all meet again after Brix has been gone for 6 years, for the funeral of one of their own. Some are welcoming and warm upon her return, one is not so warm. Nash was her first love and she his, then she just up and left town, never to be heard from again until she arrives for Trey's funeral. The road to forgiveness and redemption for these two is a hard one, but the powers that be make sure to put them together as often as possible so that they are alone to talk things through, more than once. Needless to say, as it is with secrets, they are never meant to remain hidden.<br /><br />I loved these characters. They are just what you would expect of children growning up in a small town who have known each other all of their lives. They have been through and did everything together. They were friends and would do anything for each other. Nash was the bad boy of their group. Cute with beautiful blue eyes, he always seemed to find himself in trouble. Nash had a hard start in life because of his abusive father and then the death of his mother. With no other family he quit school and went to work for his friend Eli's father working on cars and welding. Nash was also the love of young Brix's life. She was sassy, beautiful, smart and loved Nash with all of her heart. Her sudden departure from their home town left Nash broken. She never said she was leaving and never said goodbye. So if he was bitter when she returned, she felt she deserved it.<br /><br />This story flowed effortlessly and although there were multiple characters engaging in this story, you never got lost in it. Everything that was brought up or that was done was right in line with the story, bringing in the supporting characters as they were needed and everyone stayed on script. The story had a bid of everything in it from nastalgia to drama, laughter to tears, happiness to anger, love and fights.<br /><br />I adored this book and I highly recommend this book to everyone!",5.0,Books,1,7

"Niagen as NAD+ Precursor: NAD+ boosters are said to have many benefits for older people, and perhaps some for young people too.  They are meant to restore NAD+ levels in aging adults so that their bodies would act more like younger versions.  I am not rating the benefits.  These are still being researched and at this time, you have to take these supplements in the hope that the purported benefits are real.  That is what I have been doing, and now I am taking this product for a while.  The main reason why I am concerned is the lack of any independent verification of the purity and content,  any certification of good manufacturing practices (GMP), or FDA registration of the lab.

"Poignant, Brilliant, Compelling.: ‚ÄúThe Grapes of Wrath‚Äù Is one of the greatest American novels written.  It‚Äôs author, John Steinbeck, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962 ostensibly because of this book.  Indeed, I place it within the top twenty or so books ever written in the English language.<br /><br />Steinbeck set the novel in the 1930s when America was gripped by both the Great Depression and the so-called Oklahoma Dustbowl; twin evils that wreaked havoc upon the social fabric of the nation.  One consequence was that tens of thousands of poor farmers from the south in general and Oklahoma in particular lost their farms.  This despite the fact that these farms may have been worked by the families for generations.  Their response was to move to California where life would, thy hoped, be so much better.  And so, the great migration began.<br /><br />Steinbeck‚Äôs novel is set against the backdrop of this great migration.  He introduces the reader to the Joad family.  Laid destitute be the depression, the Joads strike out for California.  Their experiences are rarely happy but Steinbeck manages to describe their many set backs with magnificent prose. The reader becomes bound up with the novel and the experience.  The characters are plausible and compelling.  Steinbeck has produced a masterpiece.<br /><br />I cannot more highly recommend this novel to readers of this review.  To have not read ‚ÄúThe Grapes of Wrath‚Äù is to have missed one of life‚Äôs great literary moments.  John Steinbeck has managed to a produce a wonderful poignant work.  I suspect I will be re-reading the novel in the near future.",5.0,Books,1,7

Blowing/Sucking power better than Toro, not considerably though. But where this blower shines is the ease of adding/removing attachments - so easy to switch from blowing to sucking, easy to remove the bag and empty it, much better than Toro.<br /><br />Also, having to replace multiple Toro bags, this Worx bag is much sturdier and better built.<br /><br />Not sure about durability yet since I had it only for a month, but I will update this review if something goes wrong.<br /><br />Love it.",5.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,1,25
"Well worth buying..: First off, the actual name of this figure is the Super Poseable HELM'S DEEP aragorn. (Amazon has it labeled as just SP aragorn.) You might just think this is a slight re-tooling of the original HDA, but it isn't. Its a whole new figure, that is far, FAR superior to the old model.<br /><br />Everything about this figure is better. There is much more detail. For instance, Aragorn's sleeves are red, like in the movie. The orignal just had grey sleeves. Also, the Evenstar is sculpted on his neck. The texturing on his clothing is very nice, and much more detailed than the original. Headsculpt still is a little lacking. (A little too red-shaded.)<br /><br />The figure is indeed super poseable. It has 32 points of articulation, the original only had around 15. He has double jointed elbows, ball-jointed hips, his torso can twist, and even his toes and fingers bend. (He can actually stand like a normal person. The original had his legs spread like he was doing the split.) He doesn't have a dorky leg-squeezing action like the original. (I despise action features.)<br /><br />He comes with the same sword and knife as the original. The both fit very nicely in their appointed sheaths.<br /><br />Overal, and A+ figure. Worth buying, even if you own the original.",5.0,Unknown,1,32
"Effective: I had been using a different type of light bulb for my indoor herbs (cilantro and thyme currently) and they were looking very scrawny and had quite a few yellow leaves.  Within 48 hours of installing and using this light hooked up to a timer for about 7.5 hours, my herbs are looking greener and fuller!  What an amazing change in such a short time.  Will definitely buy more in the future as my indoor growing expands.",5.0,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,1,25

"Third Day's best yet!: Who can resist the passion and energy of Third Day?  They are the southern rockers Christian music never knew they were missing.  Those Mac Powell vocals send chills down my spine!  The addition of gospel style background  vocals on several tracks blends well, even with their edgier songs.<br />&quot;I've Always Loved You&quot; starts the album off right.  In the  tradition of &quot;Love Song&quot; from their first album, it is written  from the perspective of Jesus, assuring us of his love for us &quot;Though  you turn away, I'll tell you still, don't you know I've always loved you,  and I always will?&quot; in a melodic, vocals driven piece.  &quot;Can't  Take the Pain&quot; later in the album gives Simon Peter a voice to express  his guilt and remorse.  &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;Took My Place&quot; and  &quot;Never Bow Down&quot; are harder, more electric guitar driven songs,  but still very enjoyable.  &quot;What Good&quot; is also faster and edgier,  but a great portrayal Jesus' encounter with the rich young man in Mark  8.<br />The 5th track, &quot;Your Love O Lord&quot; is my favorite.  It takes  just a few verses from Psalm 36 and creates a praise song that touches the  depths of my soul.  If you like this song, check out their new worship  album being released July 11th.  I have heard the prerelease and trust me,  it is AWESOME!",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

Although Amazon was very good playing the middle man.<br /><br />Once I finally got the ladder, it was way too heavy.  Very difficult for two people to handle it.  I think the description says it is 87 lbs, but it feels like 150.  Considering that you need to push the ladder up from the bottom to stand it up against a wall, the majority of those pounds will be over your head, so very difficult to maneuver.<br /><br />I took it apart into two sections and it is still a big effort to stand up.<br /><br />Definitely not worth the $$$.

Purchased this gate to extend all the way across the one car garage door opening to keep children and dogs inside and it works well.  It is strong, a little longer than I need but the excess folds up well and out of the way on the ends.  The latch for the gate works well and even if the children can figure out how to open it their finger strength isn't strong enough to do so, not even the 5 year old.  The only thing I wish was different would be that the gate width was wider.  When I come through the gate carrying stuff in or out I almost always have to lift my arms high enough to carry over the gate rather than through it and that is why I gave 4 stars and not 5.

"An Exciting Bit of Action!: Fever Rising is fun action romp with likable, compelling characters that you want to root for. The story focuses on the bad-ass heroine Cassidy Havok, who is relentless in her pursuit of victory. Every battle with her is a treat to read. The other main protagonist is the powerful arena combatant Kaden, who befriends Cassidy in her battle against The System. Together they seem unstoppable and it is super exciting to watch it unfold. Over the course of the story, I very much enjoyed the banter and relationship that forms between the two heroes. In addition, there is also a fun sibling comradery between Kaden and his younger sister Nix weaved throughout. Finally, the story‚Äôs villain Cath displays an imposing presence and is clearly not a foe to be taken lightly. His goals and beliefs make you despise what he stands for and really want to see the heroes take him down.<br />The author Riley excels at describing action sequences in such a way that you can picture every weapon strike and turn of the battle like you are watching a movie. While, the world of Fever Rising is also well-crafted, with contrasting locations. There are the large System Sectors, that feel like the mega-city from Judge Dredd and then expansive Wilds where nature has taken back ownership and rebels reside outside of the System‚Äôs watchful eye. It all fits together quite nicely and I found it to be an immersive experience.<br />I was happy to hear that K.M Riley is still writing and was releasing a new book. This one is a bit different from her last two, which were fantasy stories. This one is a dystopian future/action adventure, which reminds me of The Hunger Games, but with action sequences more akin to anime. Overall, I had a great time with this book. You can tell that the author has grown and become a better writer and storyteller. It‚Äôs not overly long, but it‚Äôs a fun ride that doesn‚Äôt let up, right until the last page. I highly recommend It!<br /><br />NOTE: I would like to state that this review is based on an advance copy of the book I was given to read before release.",5.0,Books,1,7

I bought this saw thinking that it might have a little more power due to it being brushless and liked the idea of having a light and rafter hook.  There is not much difference in power between the 2 (the dcs565 might have a little more torque but not enough to make much of a difference in performance).  Also, I have not found the light to be all that useful.  The main advantage of the dcs565 to me is the fact that it is about 2"" narrower than the dcs391.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"overrated by clueless prog nerds - get ""Make Believe"" instead!: Sorry, but this album is a pretty mediocre affair, not only compared to earlier PF efforts but also by pop music standards. Sure, the musicianship is tight, but so it is on your average Avril Lavigne album. Thing is, ""Panamarenko"" is a pretty plodding affair with at best mediocre melodies (exception being the dreamy ""Wake Up"", an obvious send-up of the Beatles classic ""I'm Only Sleeeping""). Also the album has a way overproduced, tinny sound where the rhythm section of the band has been muted and canned by synthesizers. To add to the disappointment this features Asa's least inspired vocal performance, gone is her sweet accent and urgency from the earlier albums.<br /><br />""Shangri-La"" was already a step down from ""Make Believe"", suffering from redundant overlength due to inept editing but still had strong hooks but ""Panamarenko"" is yet another notch down.<br /><br />Get ""Make Believe"" first and then decide for yourself if you like the band enough to dig further in their discography.",2.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,0,8

And this is the biggest problem of this item. I tried many ways to clean it, there are something I would like share: 1. You need to keep an eye on the inside of the tank and base, especially when you use it at high speed. It's very easy to grow mold and ordor, even in 2 or 3 days you will find mold inside. 2. Once you see light mold inside, clean it immediately. Use small brushes which could reach the tiny space of the base. And for the tank, put some water with mild detergent (I use detergent for dish, I see some people even used bleach, but I don't know whether the bleach could be used), and wait for like one hour, then shake shake shake, then repeat, until you feel it becomes clean. The one I don't use frequently now is kept almost clean.<br /><br />But you can see that the cleaning is really tough. If you want a humidifier working everyday on a high speed, this one I will not recommend. And when you choose a humidifier, take care of the cleaning part, and try the one with tank which could be cleaned with bleach to disinfect.<br /><br />Other aspects of this item I didn't see big problem, quiet and works well, until you need to clean it...",3.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

"Great Camera: I'm just a weekend/vacation (at best) photographer. I don't need overly complex. I don't want too simple. So, the D5100 with much of what makes the D7000 such a stunning performer, but with less fuss over settings, is absolutely perfect for me. I did buy the kit and I had gotten the 55-200 MV VR lense with the D3100. While the lense is certainly up to most challenges, I will at some point upgrade to better glass as I've always believed nothing can be better than the weakest link. Still, the pictures these lenses are producing are simply stunning.<br />HDR is good. It's not quite as significant as the manual suggests (you have to push exposure over and under to get maximum results), but I didn't buy the camera for HDR to begin with. I'm also not a big videographer, but have taken a few videos and was pleasantly surprised at the quality. Autofocus works a bit slow in lower light, but in bright light, my videos were nice and in-focus. I did buy a really good Sandisk 16 GB Class 10 card, so I suspect it helps as well.<br />Setting up the camera is simple and straight forward. I didn't even have to read the manual in much detail, except to get a few refence points. I do recommend downloading the fuller PDF user guide suppled with the camera, as it provides more information than the book in the box.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

Although I can‚Äôt seem to have it save it as a preset. Seems like I have to reprogram it every time I change color scheme. Either way it‚Äôs a neat feature. Only bad thing I noticed is the circled keys, aren‚Äôt really tapered at the edges so it feels much closer to the keys to the side compared to traditional squares keys. All in all I‚Äôd recommend this keyboard for any one who wants a wired RGB keyboard that looks modern and sleek.",5.0,Video_Games,1,33

"Well Worth Owning: Some people don't think Don Gillis compares to our best American Composers such as Copland, Thomson or Grofe.  I disagree.  All of the Gillis works are at least as interesting as those by other American Composers.  Gillis wrote light, fun music and this album is no exception.  The only other reviewer when I wrote this, didn't like the concerto, especially the last movement.  I enjoyed it almost more than the symphony and liked the last movement the best.  To each his own, I suppose.  Maybe Gillis was an imitator and that's what bothers some people.  It seems to me that imitation can be very skillful as one can imitate without sounding too much like another composer.  Gillis had his own unique sound and while these works aren't his best, there are certainly still very good.  With almost no Gillis recordings available a couple of years ago, it's wonderful to have these now.  Gillis may not have been the most original composer or even considered a top-notch composer, but his works are so enjoyable and listenable, who cares?",4.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8
"Awesome Variety of Workouts: This is a very challenging series with excellent variety. Some of the workouts are almost impossible to finish, including one where the model/athletes literally cannot finish themselves and Steve has to acommodate.

"As good as OEM at 1/4 the price: I waited on Blue Nook to have the Wasabi batteries for the RX100 because I really enjoyed the version they had for E-PM1. Since I was hit with a bit of ""brand loyalty"" i jumped on these as soon as they were out!<br /><br />I can't give scientific or exact info on the batteries, but I do know they seem to last as long as the OEM batteries. With the OEM batteries I shot ~200 shots per day and would get down to 1/2 capacity. These Wasabi batteries seem to mimic the life of the originals. Couple that with the option to externally charge them and you have a winner. Sadly I can't say how long each took to recharge since I'd either charge overnight or run off and do other errands. The car adapter is a plus for those times may need an emergency boost. But right now 1 OEM plus 2 of these will last me longer than I need.<br /><br />I hope they make batteries for my next camera! It may not be for a few years though, lol.<br /><br />Maybe when I have some spare time I'll try and do a charge/discharge test. I generally don't let my batteries go below 1/2 as going under 40% could lessen the life - according to what the internets told me ;).",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"Not a great Fitbit alternative: I purchased this fitness band as an alternative to a Fitbit just to see what else is out there. I‚Äôve had a Fitbit charge HR for a few years, and that is what I am used to. This has a great design. I love how it charges with no cords. Really genius. I also really liked the idea of having multiple bands to switch it out when needed. But that‚Äôs about all that I really like about it. The app is awful. It crashes whenever I try to search for an update. Sleep tracking has minimal useful information. I woke up in the morning and took it off the charger, it had registered over 200 steps while plugged in overnight. The touch sensitivity to scroll through functions was sad. Very frustrating to try to start a workout. When checking heart rate, the screen would time out before it would get hr about half the time I tried. And life to check time rarely worked, I almost always had to tap for the time. I will stick to my Fitbit.",2.0,Unknown,0,32

An exploration of how men became monks or didn't: I am reading them in order so this is my 9th book since  I started with the prequel a Rare Benedictine. each of the books' mysteries involve some aspect of medieval life that is described in detail. This one deals with how men became monks in medieval times .  The mystery is why Meriet at his young age (actually old for a novice they can start as infants!) wants to become a monk. The larger mystery really unfolds later in the book. This one seems slower than the preceding ones - a lot more detail and description. The final solution is a bit rushed as a result- but a good additional to the Cadfael Chronicles- now to watch the TV adaptation.,5.0,Books,1,7

"The Demise of the Bronze Age ‚Äì A Detailed Analysis: The end of the Bronze Age, which has been estimated to have occurred c. 1200 B.C., has been the subject of much discussion among scholars for many years. The main issue being: How could several thriving empires ‚Äì the civilized world at the time - all ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù collapse within just a few years/decades? In this fascinating book, the author, an archaeologist and expert on this topic, attempts to answer this intriguing question.<br /><br />Starting a few centuries earlier (fifteenth century B.C.), the author sets the scene. He describes the empires/civilizations that existed at the time, how they evolved and how they interacted with each other, especially through trade. He then describes the destruction of each of these major centers: when it happened and how it appears to have happened. He then discusses each of the probable causes for such a widespread calamity. Throughout, he backs up his arguments with solid, up-to-the-minute archaeological evidence and also presents the views of other scholars in this field.  Finally, he describes what he and several other experts believe actually happened to bring an end the Bronze Age ‚Äì something which I found rather surprising yet very compelling.<br /><br />For me, this book was quite engaging and very hard to put down. The author writes for a wide readership in a style that is authoritative yet accessible, lively, friendly and very captivating. I believe that this book can be enjoyed by any interested reader; however, ancient history/archaeology enthusiasts, like me, should be in for a treat.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Didn't last a weekend.: UPDATE:<br />Customer service reached out to me after submitting my original review, and sent an updated model (free of charge) to help solve the issues (and surely to alleviate negative feedback).  It appears to be better sealed, has a better locking mechanism (twist lock), etc.  I have only unboxed it so far, but will write a proper review on that product once we've actually used it.  In the meantime, I'll lift this review to 3 stars, only because the customer service was very proactive and helpful.  I certainly can't bump this higher than that without misleading folks into thinking this is worth getting (it is not).<br /><br />Product itself = 2 stars.<br />Customer Service = 5 stars.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />A couple things on this... it's a relatively cheap feeder, so I wasn't expecting intuitive controls (spoiler: they were not) or luxurious materials (spoiler: they were not), but I at least expected pretty consistent portion delivery and for the feeder to be pretty sealed up to protect it from tampering from your pets, or insects/ants, etc.<br /><br />Spoiler: It was not.<br /><br />Let's start with the portions, because that's easy.  I set it up for a particular portion size, then proceeded to manually trigger it again and again.  The portions varied *wildly* between activations.  Ultimately, I was in a rush and decided to live with it.  At worse, our kitty would just have too much to eat... better than too little right?<br /><br />But then I noticed the design of the lid.  It's a *really* flimsy plastic lid, with the little lock dial.  No gasket, no good seal, nothing.  In fact, the lid didn't even sit perfectly on the bin, leaving a gap of a few mm around parts... it relied on the little plastic lock just to keep it shut.<br /><br />So fast forward to when I found it, days later... ripped open by our small cat.  Yeah, she's a determined little thing, but this looked like child's play to her.  She knocked it over (it's top heavy and far too light in general), and appears to have easily opened the lid.  I assume she just got her claws into the lid gap and pulled, easily dislodging the lock pin.<br /><br />If you have a grazer pet, this feeder may be fine for you.  If you have an opportunistic one (as in, they'll eat whatever they can find, whenever they find it), skip this one and move on.  It will never hold up to a determined animal...",3.0,Pet_Supplies,0,26

"The best present for your at home baker: Got this in my stocking this Christmas and it's just wonderful! I wanted to give it a try so I just whipped up some pudding. Now the first time I tried to put it on I'm thinking ""why is this not going on?"" So I looked at my whisk and saw that not every wire was exactly how it should be. A couple had bent a bit. I've had my mixer over 20 years so I guess that can happen.  I I just needed to gently move those wires to the correct area as I slid it into the silicone. Wanting to make sure it wasn't a fluke I took it off and tried it again. Yup, just requires you to look at where every wire is and that they are all going and it will go on smoothly.<br />Now this little thing is wonderful. It pretty much wiped almost all the pudding from my whisk as you'll see in my last picture.<br />I'm not sure why some other people had such a hard time with this but it's my new best friend!

"Set me on a path to a life changing transformation: At first glance, this book looks like it is for the relatively fit and the &#34;skinny fat&#34; to become more elite in their fitness level. I was not anywhere near that level (I was very obese and weak), but I needed to do something different. I set out to learn about weightlifting, and I am glad I found this book as my guide. The information was logical and reasonable -- no quick  fixes, rather it was a systemic way to &#34;do the work.&#34; Initially I started out too weak to do the big compound exercises that he recommends and too intimated to work out in the free weights area anyways. So I started (contrary to the author's recommendation) doing similar exercises on the machines, but making sure to follow his process and philosophy. The physical changes I have made are not dramatic, but they do amount to good, solid progress. It's been about 1-1/2 years. I have lost 65 lbs. I have gone from struggling with the 30 lbs minimum weight on a chest press machine to comfortably bench pressing 65 lbs, and I have built up the necessary strength and flexibility in my hamstrings to deadlift ... And the mental changes that come with the increased capabilities have made me a whole new me! I have recommended this book many times, and expect to continue to do so.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Absolutely Great!: I loved almost everything about SUMMER OF NIGHT. The characters were intruiging, and the setting was marvelous. If you liked IT by Stephen King, you will like Summer of Night. While it is somewhat of a slow starter, the reader will be entralled in the story.

"I felt cheated!: I am habitually in awe of Stephen King's works and the the abysmal depth of though and feeling behind all the &#34;horrors&#34; he so masterfully spins. Unfortunately, Cell is an unhappy exception. The narrative is maddeningly slow, while the plot never gets off the ground and shuffles along with the crowds of other zombie stories. The characters seem paper thin, and the dialog is, for the most part, either bland or unbelievable.<br /><br />My biggest peeve, however, is the distasteful excess of gratuitous violence. King rarely stoops down to flinging gore at his readers just for the shock value, because he has a way of conjuring up the atmosphere of dread by subtler means. With Cell even the most blood-thirsty members of the reading world will have their fill of details of physical destruction. I found it a cheap trick not worthy of the master.",1.0,Books,0,7

"Delightfully absurd mashup: Millicent Aberly accidentally activates her genius brother Hubert‚Äôs new time machine, which throws her into a future where the Roman Empire did not fall, but expanded, even colonizing space. The Romans now fight the space squid for control of‚Ä¶space. Millicent is saved from death-by-space-squid by the dashing lady centurion Sangfroid, who she develops a crush on. As they make their way through the ship, Sangfroid dies, and Millicent returns to her original time and place. Intrigued by Sangfroid and wracked with guilt, Millicent uses the time machine again to try to prevent Sangfroid‚Äôs death. Many tries later, Sangfroid accidentally comes back to London and Millicent‚Äôs time. Then other strange phenomena begin, starting with giant squid and another Roman soldier from Sangfroid‚Äôs time showing up in the Aberly house. Matters get further muddled when there‚Äôs another time machine accident; and Millicent has to decide whether to save the version of London she knows, or keep her beloved Sangfroid in existence.<br /><br />I have long found the work of HP Lovecraft interesting and hysterical: I went to the university that is Miskatonic‚Äôs closest analog (we have a library with books bound in human skin!), and while there I connected with many science fiction fans who loved the Victorian era and all things steampunk. Some of them impressed upon me that linear time is inherently straight and that subversion of it would be queer. This was before same-sex marriage was legalized anywhere in the US, and my friends bitterly joked that their so-called gay marriage agenda was to destroy linear time. So this book tied together some of my fondest memories of my college friends together: a bunch more of them were Classics geeks who could name the five worst Roman emperors. I‚Äôll be recommending this book or loaning it out to as many of them as I can.<br /><br />The story blends steampunk, science fiction, alternate history, romance, and a tea cult. I love McKnight‚Äôs imagination: strange creatures and technology are everywhere, causing mayhem. I wasn‚Äôt sure where the plot would go and got surprised several times. Nothing seemed out of place, though. Most of the ‚Äúhey what about‚Ä¶‚Äù questions I had got resolved, although I think some mysteries are still there to explore in further books.<br /><br />The characters and dialogue are strong, somehow remaining grounded as their reality gets wackier. Watching proper Victorians deal with the fantastical made me smile: they rationalize and hold on to their realities in believable fashion. Millicent worries about her ruined dress when there are far more dire concerns because it‚Äôs what she‚Äôs used to caring about. Hubert and his fianc√©e Sophia are gloriously neurotic. If you enjoy witty British banter, this is your cup of tea. Oh, that was awful, but I stand by my words. The romance between Millicent and Sangfroid is very sweet, and there is a hilarious secondary love story and yet another serious crush. There‚Äôs a happy-for-now at the end of The Tea Machine that asks more questions than it answers, so their story shall continue.<br /><br />I‚Äôm not surprised that the Victorian ladies misgender Sangfroid, but I did raise a brow at the Romans who do so, when they recognize that centurion Gallo is female. Perhaps there‚Äôs a reason for that I missed. Sangfroid says she's obviously female, but her idea of obvious may not be in line with the others she meets.<br /><br />The narrative is very twisty: there are several timelines to keep track of, and we‚Äôre dumped in the middle of the action. I liked how we start with Sangfroid‚Äôs getting the background information after the fact, but the flashbacks and explanations later in the story felt less potent in how they were conveyed.<br /><br />In the copy I got, there were enough typos that I felt it needed another proofreading pass from the editor(s) at Ylva.<br /><br />I received a free copy for review, but bought one to use as a loaner once I finished it. If you‚Äôre not sure if it‚Äôs for you, use Amazon‚Äôs sample chapters to see if you like the humor and vivid setting. It‚Äôs an original screwball premise with unpredictable twists, and I look forward to the sequel.",5.0,Books,1,7

"This is one of the only remaining GOOD Lasko 20x20 fans.  Highly recommended.: This among the finest models of Lasko fans.  These good ones make great air filters if you get a 20x20x4 3M filter and out it on the input side.  Really cleans a lot of air and lasts for decades. The one I bought in the mid 90s had a dry bearing and my attempt to oil it cases me to break it.  I'll know better next time.  I keep these running 24/7/365 so it had an amazing life.  I hot glued foam to make it a ducted fan and it improved the filter performance immensely.  Now, I've got to figure out how I can transfer my duct or move the new motor to the old fan.  The duct and hot glue really quieted it down too.  It's a cool idea, especially in these covid-19 days.  That filter I described may not be quite good enough for most viruses but covid 19 is a large one so it might.  Anyway, the fan is a serious, no BS fan.  For some reason, I had to hunt harder for the good ones.  There used to be a model, and in the reviews was a guy that compared 18 of these fans to weed out the crummy ones.  Now, Amazon doesn't carry any of the good ones, not the one with that incredible review, but lots of the crummy models.  I don't understand.  The good ones cost another $12.

"Small Stars and Stripes Bowl is Perfect for My Parents' Small Cat, Angel: DII's Stars and Stripes Ceramic Pet Bowl coordinates well with DII's Stars and Stripes Pet Bed. Both are very patriotic. My parents' small female cat, Angel, is a Flame Point Siamese. She was a stray cat that my parents adopted. She's not patriotic but my parents are very patriotic. Dad served in the Vietnam War. Angel loves drinking and eating out of her Stars and Stripes Ceramic Pet Bowl. The bowl has a silicon rim on its bottom that keeps it from sliding around, spilling its contents. My parents keep it on the marble hearth in the living room. Because she was once a stray, and because she sheds extensively, Angel is primarily an outdoor cat. When she comes inside from the wooden patio deck, my parents allow her to drink or eat from her Stars and Strips Ceramic Bowl. The small size bowl is perfect for her.<br /><br />My parents keep the bowl next to the Stars and Stripes Pet Bed from DII. The bed is also a small size and is perfect for Angel; she will take short afternoon naps in it. Sometimes, Mom will pick up the bed, with Angel sleeping in it, and gently rock it in her lap. When Angel gets tired, she will leap out of the bed and trod downstairs to the basement's workshop where she lives. DII Stars and Stripes Ceramic Pet Bowl is easy to clean. My parents don't put it in the dishwasher; instead, they wash it by hand. Also, they haven't put it in the microwave oven. I could see where one could because the dish is very thick and sturdy. It is a bowl that is suitable for humans to dine from. It would make a great gift for your beloved cat, especially around the 4th of July.",5.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26

They're so great but will drive you crazy having to pull them up all the time. They fall and slouch all the way down to my ankles. And I don't have little calves- they just need to be a little tighter. My original unedited review follows:<br /><br />These are luxuriously soft- even softer than they look. I'm 5'6"", about 220 lbs, and they fit great. They can reach above my knee or be slouched down, and they seem to stay up pretty well. I love the gradient color and the great thing is that the top and bottom seem to have the same amount of stretch so they can be flipped either way. They're currently priced at $20, which seems fair- but I wouldn't want to pay any more than that for them.

"It works and is great for that, but it needs a few tweaks.: This was the only wrist brace I could find that restrained the full length of the fingers.  I held off buying it because I thought it was just too expensive.  But I have to have it and I'm glad I do.<br /><br />I do have a few complaints.<br />1) I have it set up so the only velcro I have to take off is the middle strip.  Everything else I just slide out. However, it didn't take long for the very fine velcro to wear out.  So if I flex my arm a certain way, I can accidentally put pressure on this strap and pop it loose.  Sometimes pressing down on the hook part firmly will help hold it in place better.  But they need to use a different fastening system.<br /><br />2) I am a man with size large hands, but the strap for my thumb barely fits over it.  I realize it may be a bit difficult to make a brace with the strap closer to the base of the thumb, but I would like them to try.  I often wake up with my thumb not under the strap.<br /><br />3) My biggest complaint is the black cloth covering.  It feels nice at first, but this material is NOT breathable.  I don't normally sweat during sleep but I am constantly waking up with a sweaty palm.  Aside from it feeling gross, it quickly resulted in the covering smelling like a sweaty sock.  My fix was buying super cheap and thin wash cloths and putting one in the brace before my hand.  That way sweat is absorbed by the wash cloth and I simply change it out everyday.<br />I would like to see the manufacturer not only using a different material that is breathable, but they may also need to change the brace insert to a mesh, or with selectively placed holes in the palm area, to allow air flow.<br /><br />Despite my relatively low rating, I would buy it again if I had to since I couldn't find another one and it does actually work for carpal tunnel.",3.0,Health_and_Household,0,16

Normaly I only buy Sony for my electrics. Now Sony is still a great electric company. But since I just bought a VCR\DVD from Panasonic, and it worked okay, I figured this one would to. And in my opinion and some of my friends' opinion it is great. Ok now more about this discman. No. 1, I feel it is very easy to operate, in you read the directions. Also it is easy to turn it off, just press and hold down 'Stop.' Also after you turn it off or press Stop or Pause, once you press play again, it will start from the exact second, it ended on. No. 2, it runcs on 2 AA batteries. This is not only a discman, but a AM\FM radio. It can up to 20 stations on FM and 10 stations on AM. This discman can play CDs, MP3 CD, audio CD-R, and audio CD-RW, but not ID3 tags. This plays up to 75 hrs of MP3 and up to 33 hrs of CD music.

"A Heroine for Our Times: This finale to Ibby's tale takes the reader on a wonderful ride of individual courage in the face of ultimate evil. The authors have woven a story with a rich tableau of word images that immediately locks the reader  into the action. You can almost taste, feel, smell the heat and liquid metal that Ibby draws upon herself to act as an external skin  and wings as she deals with the demons, ghosts and supernatural entities that threaten the earth. But then she has to confront the eternal conundrum of who can you trust and who is actually using YOU. Her profound goodness and mission as a protector draws the reader to want this story to be continued in another tale. Those who have read other stories by Ms Knorr will want to revisit ""Born of Air"" to see Ibby again. I know I did. Congratulations to this writing duo of A.L. Knorr and A.D. Schneider.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Handy chart for testing kids eyesight: Me and my husband wear glasses, so there is a strong probability that our kids will need them eventually. This is a good tool to use at home to periodically check on when to bring them in to see an optometrist.

I feel more confident that we will be able to catch any decline in my kids sight having this on hand.<br /><br />I would suggest storing it flat and pressed for a while after opening. It is still curled a bit, but it did improve.<br /><br />I plan to keep this in storage, stored flat, in between screenings. This gives it a better chance to flatten out and prevents the kids from memorizing the shapes.<br /><br />Overall this is pretty cute and useful, just a but harder to get the curl out than expected. 4/5",4.0,Industrial_and_Scientific,1,19
"A wonderful blend of interesting characters: Not having read a Mathias book for awhile I bought Through the Wildwood (The Legend of Vanx Malic) with a view to seeing if I wanted to get back into reading this genre.  I had been disappointed by some in this genre but admit that I had always enjoyed books by Mathias.<br />From the very start of the book I was intrigued. I loved the story line, somewhat relevant to life today, the Duke having found his wife had a lover, Vanx, so got rid of him, or so he thought.<br />Vanx is a creature who does not take that sort of action well. He is determined to fight back and uses all his wily abilities to escape what was supposed to be his future as a slave. Princess Highlake, the Duke and Duchess‚Äô daughter, was involved in freeing him and in the process picks up a disease. Vanx is now desperate to find a cure for her.<br />The book moves along introducing the different characters, some who will leave in this book and others that I believe, from the ending anyway, follow into the next book in the series.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Incorrect instructions, poor packaging: This lamp looks nice and it functions well with the Phillips 19 watt LED bulb that I am using with it. The description of this lamp is correct. It does stand 30 inches tall.<br /><br />The switch for this lamp is a toggle switch. Its about 2 feet into the power cord. This can be inconvenient for a table lamp depending on where you place it.<br /><br />When I received the lamp, I quickly noticed that there were some scratches at the joints. It looks as if someone tried to assemble the lamp, failed, and it was repackaged and sold again. However, the packaging appeared to look like it was from the factory.<br /><br />Overall, my biggest gripe was the instructions included with the lamp. While it didn't take me more than 15 minutes to unpack and build the lamp, it was frustrating to have to figure out how to construct the lamp on its own. In addition to this, the small wrench that you will need to put the lamp together was difficult to find in the box, and could easily be overlooked. You absolutely need this wrench to put the lamp together.",3.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,0,30

"I was surprised by how much blue light electronics  produce!: I received my Cyxus blue light filtering glasses this week and was very excited to try them. I have been wanting to get a pair of these glasses for myself to help me fall asleep easier at night.  I have heard that blue light can really negatively impact your quality of sleep, so I wanted to find a pair of glasses that would help protect my eyes from the blue light during the evening. My boyfriend has a pair of Cyxus blue light filtering glasses and he absolutely loves them!<br /><br />I ordered the  Cyxus Blue Light Filtering Glasses in the leopard pattern.  The glasses came in a nice quality box and also came with a glasses case for convenient storage between uses.  The glasses case came in black with a snap button enclosure.  The glasses themselves looked stylish and just like the picture!<br /><br />When I tried the glasses on I immediately noticed that  they did not fit me! Unfortunately, the part of the glasses that covers the bridge of your nose was too narrow to fit my nose properly. Due to the small nose bridge of these glasses, I will not be able to wear them.  So if you have a bit of a wider bridge on your nose I would not recommend this shape of glasses for you.  There is another version of Cyxus light blocking glasses that are more suitable for a wider bridged nose.  My boyfriend owns this pair from Cyxus and I tried them on and they fit my nose fine!<br /><br />Even though the glasses didn't fit, I did test them out to see how effective they were. I noticed that the yellow lenses really did help block the blue light emitted from my electronics.  Prior to trying these glasses, I did not realize how much blue light there is!<br /><br />Overall, I learned that blue light blocking glasses can be very helpful in protecting your eyes from blue light. I was lucky enough to be given the opportunity to receive these glasses at  a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",4.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Not For Me: Purchased this from Amazon two months ago. The device depends upon a U-shaped leaf spring to hold it in place. Once in place, the leaf spring imparts pressure on the cartilaginous septum that divides the two nostrils. Even if the device's leaf spring is adjusted to the absolute minimum pressure needed to stay in place, I can't get to sleep - much too foreign a feeling for me. A notable aside is that though the packaging states the device is ""medium"" size, the company doesn't appear to make any other sizes. Even If I could tolerate the device, a larger size would be much more appropriate. Not that it matters but given what the device must have cost, there is an incredible profit margin for this Australian manufacturer.",1.0,Unknown,0,32

Sweet low gain OD pedal: I‚Äôm playing a tele into a tweed deluxe clone. Running the pedal with gain about 10 o clock and pedal last in the chain just before the amp. Not typical of pedal order for OD pedals but the  designer of the Timmy (the model for the Pure Sky) said that‚Äôs where it should go in order to drive the pre amp tubes. I believe he‚Äôs right because it‚Äôs a gorgeous sound. I like the vintage loose breakup at 10 but others may prefer more or less drive. Comes with a little adapter cable to power pedal with an external battery which is odd but more than you get with other small pedals. I power mine off a power brick so not an issue. Pretty quiet even though the deluxe is fairly noisy by nature. There‚Äôs a YouTube video doing an AB comparison of the Pure Sky with a Timmy and the differences are pretty minimal.

"Very good product that has lots of useful features: I did a lot of research in trying to find a phone for my dad that's easy to use but works well with his hearing aides.  This phone is pretty pricey, but it does work well as advertised.  I definitely recommend it.  After having it for 2 months, my parents like it and find it easy to use.<br /><br />I'd strongly recommend that you spend the time setting it up and being patience with testing it.  There are a lot of features for this phone, so plan on spending a good 30-45 minutes tweaking it.  It's not difficult to do, but if you want to get the most benefit out of it, you do need to put the effort into reading the great manual and learning how each setting operates and which setting is best for you of your loved one.<br /><br />Regardless if you get this phone or not, I'd strongly recommend that if you have parents you a caring for.. that you go with them to their hearing aide specialist to help  them 1) understand the options on the market and 2) ensure they are selecting a good hearing aide for their needs.  My dad just kept putting up with an old out dated hearing aide.<br /><br />After getting updated (and expensive) hearing aides it really helped him and others on the other end of the phone hear betting and understand each other.  Consider going back to tweak this phone a bit after getting new hearing aides as well.",4.0,Office_Products,1,24

"Beloved Hush Puppies slip ons replaced after 5 years: I don't usually get attached to things, especially clothes. I bought my first pair of Hush Puppies at DSW about 5 years ago and instantly loved them. They were so comfortable I actually felt guilty wearing them, as if I was breaking some age old rule about how dress shoes should feel on your feet. I bought them a full size smaller than I would any other shoe but the tight toe area loosened up after just a few weeks. Admittedly, the tops were more garment than shoe leather, but I pulled this off well until I wore through the soles, the stitching started coming loose, and the tops became ridiculously wrinkled (but never cracked).<br /><br />These aren't a direct replacement, but all the same concepts are there. They are harder to slip on that the old ones ever were, even though they are a half size bigger and are a little more formal looking. The shoes are almost too light. It's crazy really. There is now a pillowed insole which is an improvement that brings back that old feeling of somehow cheating. The extra half size makes my heel slip a little, more on one foot than the other. Size and width choices were limited. I would have gotten narrow if it had been available.<br /><br />Amazon rarely disappoints with price. These were a full $20 less than Zappos and, here's the kicker, they were shipped from Zappos who met Amazon Prime's stringent two day delivery requirements.<br /><br />In summary, these technologically advanced, super light, ridiculously comfortable dress shoes cost about half what I would pay locally. I probably won't wait 5 years to replace these however, since that was somewhat embarrassing. I will enjoy these while looking forward to what Hush Puppies has to offer a couple of years from now.",5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

Fits electric litterbox!: Unexpected events lead to us bringing a second cat into our home.  An old cat who had grown up with other cats she took to it fine.  Our 2 year old cat who had been the only pet in the house prior to this did not take it so well.  We followed every recommendation we could find and made very little very slow progress.  Our youngest cat was stressed and skittish but also frequently harassed the older cat to try and get her to play.  On top of that our youngest would not use a litter box that the other cat had used.<br />We bought two of these cages and fitted each of them with an rfid reading cat door so each cat could only access one cage.  The cage is big enough to fit an electric litter box at the bottom and the shelves create a place for a cat bed and an extra perch.  This is the best thing we have ever done for our cats.  Our scared cat almost immediately began to be less stressed and she started being affectionate and cuddly like she had been before the new arrival.  The older cat had somewhere she could got if she wanted to sleep and not be bothered.  And best of all they are both using their litterboxes now.  Our vet loved them so much she asked for pictures to show to veterinary students in her classes.,5.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26

"Here are some answers for many of the complaints and for people considering purchasing these...: Five stars...for now...<br /><br />I own a lot of headphones: Bose SoundSport, Beats Studio over ear, Klipsh Image S4, Monster iSport, Bose QC15, Sol Republic, Apple EarPods and more throughout the years.<br /><br />For the short time that I've had these, they are incredible. But first here are some answers to a few complaints.<br /><br />1. They sound horrible.<br />Answer: First, it's important to get a great fit. Try all of the different ear tips because it's imperative to get a secure, snug fit for optimal sound. Once you find a nestled fit, twist the headphones lightly into your ear until secure, yet comfortable.<br /><br />2. They aren't loud enough.<br />When I put these on, I thought the same exact thing.  I put my iPod on full blast and couldn't believe how light they sounded. However, I overlooked the fact that you can adjust the volume on both your device and on the headphones themselves. Once I turned the volume up on the headphones themselves, they got extremely loud and I couldn't hear any outside noise.<br /><br />3. They don't sync with video<br />Try the updates on Beats' website, issue seems to be fixed<br /><br />4. They lack bass.<br />Try the suggestions above and if you still don't think there is enough bass, try adjusting your equalizer on your iPod, device, etc.<br />I've found that after I've addressed my &#34;fit&#34; issues and appropriate volume for listening, these provide a great overall sound experience.<br /><br />However, I must mention that I am a little worried about the durability over the long term. After strenuous workouts, sweat and general listening I just hope for $200 that they hold up.<br /><br />The plastic piece that covers the charging port, it seems, may come off over time so it's important to be gentle.<br /><br />Overall, I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Sound is outstanding, they don't fall out not having a wire continuously get in the way is icing on the cake.<br /><br />I would highly recommend, but just be careful and gentle with them.<br /><br />And ONE MORE THING:<br /><br />A lot of electronic stores are no longer offering their protection plan for Beats products because of the massive return rate and faulty issues. So regardless of where you buy these, make sure you're happy with spending $200 with limited peace of mind of a protection plan warranty. Otherwise the manufacturer warranty is 1-year.",5.0,Electronics,1,12

"breathtakingly gorgeous writing: I LOVED this collection of connected stories, and I am very much looking forward to reading Desdemona and the Deep now.<br /><br />The writing is absolutely breathtakingly gorgeous. It was challenging at first, a bit of a tangle, and then as I read it opened up and I fell in love with it. With Athe and the Valwode, humans and gentry and goblins, and doors that open at midnight and art that can change the world.<br /><br />The characters were so layered and intriguing, so interconnected, and it was a joy to come to know them.<br /><br />There was honestly nothing I would change about it - a rare thing - and I am hereby adding CSE Cooney's name to my list of favorite and must-read authors.<br /><br />I received a review copy of this book.",5.0,Books,1,7

While Just War Theory is a Christian construct, the book avoids taking a uniquely Christian viewpoint -- entirely appropriate in a plural world if you're trying to attain common ground on the subject.

"Not perfect design but very good.: This item is made fairly well with pretty decent materials. I have a lot of Berry Compliant milspec gear and can make them as well so I am fairly familiar with construction methods. The material has water resistant backing and features decent edge binding and stitching. Not milspec but pretty good. The stitch spacing is a bit too wide and tension a bit too loose for milspec. Stitching melts so it is not cotton. I think this bag would be just fine for a citizen medical professional, but for military field use where replacements may not come for some time it is probably not quite sufficient. It has proper bar tacks in certain places and slightly wonky box stitches (but they're there). Many of the webbing attachment points are backed by an additional layer of material as well. The main bag compartment has padding for the sides, bottom and dividers. Zippers are not YKK but they're doubled for the end pouches and they move pretty decent.<br />Regarding it's design, I would say the top cover needs to be a shade longer to cover the front pouches when its all loaded and the shoulder strap isn't really load centered but centered on the main pouch only. Place heavy stuff at the back of the main pouch to help balance it. The product comes in a large box but it's crumpled into a little ball like trash. I stuffed it with things to get it to loosen up and straighten out. There is also writing on the outside in chalk pencil which looks to be QC tracking, etc. It wipes right off with a damp cloth. There is absolutely no way it's a used bag, etc. The center dividers are sewn in but no doubt easy to cut out if necessary (not a bad idea as other posters noted).  The reflective strips on the outside work quite well and seem like decent material. In heavy rain, as others noted, the front two pockets would get slightly wet. That is unfortunate because it's best to put light stuff (like bandages) in there to load balance the bag. The entire top cover is double layered with a zipper inside at the hinge point to act as a document pouch, etc.<br />I would recommend taking the bag to a sewing pro and having MOLLE webbing or a pouch of some sort sewn on the back side to even out the balance of it. Perhaps sewing a few cheap pouches directly for tourniquets, etc.<br />All in all it seems like a pretty decent bag for the money. It is made in China, of course.",4.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Will stretch, and conform to your hands profile.: I bought these at costco, 3 pair for under 20 USD. They had them on display and available to try on, and I found a pair that fit my hands, something that is easier said than done. I usually just buy cheap leather gloves from harbor freight, but I got tired of those falling apart, which they did, way to fast. They were also shaped terribly, one finger would hit the end of the finger sleeve while others wouldn't even make it half way up the finger... The leather used on the harbor freight is fine, but the back of the hand, non leather part, would just unravel and fall apart quickly. Anyhow, these all leather gloves are great, at first I thought they were a little snug, but after using them for a day or two, the leather stretches, in a good way, and molds to your hand perfectly.  If they hold up durability wise, I dont think i'll ever buy anything other than these ever again.",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"Very over-priced here, however excellent digital mini recorder: Okay, let's start with WAY OVERPRICED, However, a very good unit... I got this on super clearance at a Walgreens of all places for a cool 20 bucks - brand new, unopened. I don't think it is worth the retail price here (I think the retail at Walgreens on this was about 70, MAYBE 80) but it is a recorder of high quality. I prefer the mini disc format when you get into a price range at or above one hundred dollars, so for 150 which is where this is currently at, you are far better off looking at those types of recorders, or DAT recorders, so again, I think this is VERY pricey (and very surprised that the Walgreens retail of 70-80 was way less than that of Amazon; I'm definitely not confusing models either, I have the ICD-PX312, the exact one shown/sold here).<br /><br />That being said, however, this is a dynamite digital mini recorder. It replaced a previous model I had, a gray colored Sony with internal memory that was a great gift (I think it ran about 30 dollars retail new) and had excellent sound, lots of internal memory, but I'm not sure of the model number, but was only good for memos, really, because that had no digital method of transfer - no USB or memory card slot (i.e. if I wanted to transfer the audio to my computer I had to do it manually and in mono mode through the headphone output, which of course I did do a few times but that of course compromised the sound).<br /><br />This instead of course allows digital to digital transfer, offering an sd card slot and 2 gigs of internal flash memory with a USB output.<br /><br />I popped one of my extra micro M2 sd cards in it... a 4 gig (later I used a larger micro sd, sandisk 16gb) - i did a format of it within the unit, and it worked beautifully. This unit is outstanding because you can choose to record to either the internal flash memory or the SD and use that in your PC or simply use the mini USB output on the unit to send the flash or SD MP3 files to your PC. I am using this for podcasting, with two other people, so sort of a dialogue setting. I found that Lecture or Interview settings work best for my application (more on settings later in review). The onboard mic is better than some external mics, and you can record a decent podcast, dictation, memo, lecture, interview, or even a basic music recording on it (ideas or even a small jam), and I also recently recorded a live outdoor concert (2014 Aurora, IL 18th Annual  Blues on the Fox with Taj Mahal, Jimmy Vaughan, Tab Benoit, etc.) and it turned out being an awesome bootleg after I did some editing in Audacity...  Soooo, its applications are versatile.<br /><br />Again the on-board mic is very good, better than some of the external mics I have tried on it, but wow, even better sound than already had when I plugged in one of my Shure studio mics (however I lost a lot of input level). I have also used a quality headset mic on it and gotten good results. Sony offers several mics specifically for this model as well, each are useful for different contexts... they have a clip on, a small condenser mic and others that go right into the 1/8"" stereo microphone jack. I plan on trying the condenser mic, which runs about thirty something dollars. I haven't yet tried any of them to date, though.<br /><br />There is no hiss or buzz, interference, and it picks up minimal background noise. Depending on the settings, you can adjust the onboard sensitivity/input level (and also effects the recorded sound if you are using an external mic) and will get less or more range therefore less or more background. Sometimes I want background noise or a wider spectrum of pickup, so it is excellent that the settings allow this.<br /><br />Transferring tracks to your PC: It records by default in MP3 so the transfer to PC is lickity split... very smooth. Again, if you are recording to the built in flash memory of 2 gigs you would use the built in mini usb jack to USB, if you are recording to the SD card you  can pop it out and put it directly into your PC if you have card slots or use an SD to USB adapter if not, or you can also simply use the built in mini usb jack to USB as you would with transferring the internal flash memory.<br /><br />This unit has lots of bells and whistles, comes with software (I heard its not really necessary but hey, free software is free software), a noise cut option (used to be called ""Noise Reduction"") as its own button right on the unit, not to mention all the options in the menus.<br /><br />Ended up reading most of the manual online, and there are a host of different recording options. You can control the gain manually or use preset settings with names like ""lecture"" ""meeting"" ""interview"" ""memo"" etc. You can toggle between using the memory in the unit or your sd card. it will take an M2 sd or a reg. micro sd. I ALWAYS suggest sandisk, i won't buy any other brand. You can even edit within the unit itself - e.g. erase sections of a track, insert new recording within a track, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />It has a built in speaker for reviewing all recordings. This is probably its weakest feature... if you're using this for an application where you want to be able to playback the recordings on the same unit (as opposed to your PC/laptop/tablet), I suggest using headphones, because the speaker is pretty weak. It does not represent the quality of the recording at all. It is okay for just listening to voice notes, but anything more complex, say with music, or multiple voices, a lecture, again, use headphones for quick playback.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />Sound from onboard mic: 8.5<br />Ease of use: 9<br />Memory: 8 (2 gigs of internal flash and as much SD data you can afford via micro or M2 SD)<br />Compatibility with external microphones: 9<br />Versatility: 7.5<br />Recording Options: 9<br />Value: 5 (100 is too steep. 150 is outrageous. I would pay no more than 80 for this unit)<br />Ease of formatting and transferring to PC: 10<br />Playback sound on built in speaker or headphones: 7 (as I said the onboard speaker is probably its weakest feature, the tracks actually sound way better than the speaker plays them, so I suggest headphones for quick playback. They sound fantastic when transferred to PC)",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"My skin is so very happy!!! Highly Recommended!: I have been looking for an alternative to dryer sheets and fabric softeners. My skin is sensitive, because of eczema and acne, as well as my daughter's skin being prone to rashes due to allergies. I have found that the less chemically scented products I use to do laundry, the better. I had been about to purchase another box of dryer sheets when I ordered these up instead. I had purchased scent free dryer sheets in the past in bulk, and have run out, and haven't had anything to use. These came, and they were WAY bigger than I thought they would be. This is NOT a bad thing! In fact, I think they are less likely to disappear in the clothes since they are much bigger than those I have seen previously. They came in a nifty canvas tie string bag with a little bath wash cloth. These measure approx. 3 inches, made of wool, and are a little bit squishy. I put all 6 of them in my laundry when I started the drying process the other day. I know this says that it can decrease the drying time, which I actually did not notice to be the case, my first load took approx. 50 minutes to dry. This is about normal, so I didn't notice any difference there. (I didn't time any of my other loads, but they did not seem to be any shorter of dry time. This I am perfectly fine with.) I used Sandalwood essential oil, just a drop or two on each of the 6 balls, and I have now run maybe 10 loads through the dryer and the scent of the Sandalwood is still there, and my laundry all smells lovely. And soft. I am so very happy to not have to spend money on dryer sheets ever again. Now if they could just come up with a washer product so I never have to buy laundry soap again......<br /><br />I received this product with a promotional discount for my honest and unbiased review and these are 100% my own opinions.",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Not Sure it's Even a Three Star: I'm sad to say, Arthur C. Clarke's ""2061 (Space Odyssey Book 3)"" is nowhere near as good as the previous book in the series.  First of all, the first third of the book is almost entirely filler.  Some of it is used for positioning the pieces on the board.  But, for all intents and purposes, it could have been cut entirely from the book.  Second, the crux of the rest of the book is that a spaceship gets stranded somewhere.  It survives its ""landing,"" but can't leave without fuel.  But, unless I'm mis-remembering some of the stuff from the filler third of the book, it's surrounded by the very material it uses for propellant.  Third, the great mystery object that we're supposed to be wondering about is very obviously what it is just as soon as it's mentioned.  Third, I can't come up with any rational reason for anyone to do the things they did that resulted in the stranded spaceship.  And finally, though it's merely a bad frosting on a negative cake, almost the entire last chapter is lifted verbatim from the previous book.  I have no idea what happened to Clarke to cause him to write this book this way.  About the only thing I can say about it that isn't negative is that it isn't actively bad.  So, instead of rating it at the 2-1/2 stars I was thinking about, I'm raising my rating by a half star to a Tolerable 3 stars out of 5.<br /><br />The novels in Arthur C.

"Some nice features, and a good price for the automatic and pressure sensing pump system.: I like this, but have no reason for using it as a guest bed, I have two extra bedrooms with large beds for any guests.  I Still needed this and it's funny how things come full circle.  I'm heavy, and have some medical issues, I'm very careful not to slip and fall around the house, but it occasionally happens usually getting out of bed.  Twenty years ago my late mother who had bad joints, back, and was overweight, would occasionally fall.  I had purchased an a popular double height air bed with built in air pump for my dad.  Like me he had sleep Apnea and had problems sleeping in the master bedroom.  The bed didn't work for him, but it had a very good use.  My dad and me were not physically strong enough to safely lift my mother off the floor.  We could help her sit up, and she could scoot a little with help.  So we slipped the deflated bed underneath, and pumped it up supporting her back, she could then stand up.  It cut down on the calls to the ambulance, or trying to get multiple neighbors to help.<br /><br />I intend to use this in a similar manner for me, its easier than doing what I have to do now.  Now I have to crawl on my back to the basement door, and put my feet down the stairs to stand.  Putting this is a strategic location is perfect for letting it raise me off the floor so I can stand when I fall.  Especially useful should I get sick and become weaker.  It's usually cause I get up too quickly and get faint that causes most falls anyway.  I blew this up to check and it supports me.  However, it did uncover a bit of a problem that would result in needing a frame of some sort if using as a guest bed.  That old double height air mattress I mentioned a bit taller than this, but it used some side pontoons to keep it stable when someone uses it.  Even though this supports my weight, I'm too heavy to use it as a bed as a wrong lean and it will flip.  It doesn't flip as easy as the higher bed I described, so being lower helps, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone over 200 pounds unless some sort of frame to keep it in place.<br /><br />It seems durable, but sharp clawed pets and other sharp objects can damage it.  It has a repair kit, but better not to have to deal with on a regular basis.  Comes with it's own bag which that old bed did as well.  It's decent enough to use for guests as today 18"" is more of a standard fitted sheet size than it was when thinner mattresses were more the vogue.  A good space saver for apartment dwellers with occasional guests.  Recommended.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"EMOTIONAL & HEARTFELT JOURNEY: Georgia, 1968 ‚Äì Margaret Rose McCutcheon has just buried her husband and must now name a beneficiary for their estate in case of her demise. She is hard-pressed to do so because there is no one. No children. No family. At least none to speak of. At one time, she had two sisters and six brothers, but the lot of them were scattered to the four winds, with no one knowing where the others went. In the hope of finding at least one of her siblings, Margaret hires a detective and sets off on a journey to uncover the truth of why the family broke apart as it did.<br /><br />  West Virginia, 1901 ‚Äì When Eliza Hobbs gives birth to her sixth child, her husband is not there to welcome his daughter into the world. No surprise, because Martin is seldom there. He works in Charleston and returns to Coal Creek only when he has a mind to. Yes, he sends money on occasion, but seldom enough to make ends meet. Although Eliza believes each new child a blessing, he sees them as yet another responsibility on his already overloaded shoulders. When he discovers another child is on the way, he demands she get rid of it. he stops returning home and there is no more money.<br /><br />  Left with the children, a mountainside patch of land, and a house in sorry need of repair, Eliza seeks help and turns to someone powerful enough to hold sway over Martin and force him into providing for his family. Pushed to the brink, Martin does something unforgivable and the family is forever torn apart.<br /><br />  Now, after all these years, will Margaret be the one to find the pieces of her broken family?<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />When I Last Saw You begins with Margaret dealing with the loss of her husband, which includes going through paperwork and discovering interesting details of what her husband had tried to do for her. Curious about why he didn‚Äôt pursue the investigation he had started, she reaches out to the last investigator, Tom Bateman. He wasn‚Äôt that interested in pursuing the case, but when they met up, she was able to persuade him to try.<br /><br />From that point on, we follow Margaret and Tom as they pursue the trail of clues leading them to possibilities they had never imagined. Would Margaret find her family? Would the connection that has developed between her and Tom turn into something more than the working relationship?<br /><br />The story had sad and heartfelt moments, and I laughed, cried, and held my breath as I waited to see what would finally happen.<br /><br />I loved this book, so of course it earned 5 stars.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"NOT TOO STYLISH: In my opinion this lamp looks nicer online than in does in person. The base is all gray and it's so heavy it feels like a large piece of cement! Based on the photo online, I didn't expect the base to be all one color, but upon a second look of the photo online, I could see that the variation in color came from the lightbulb being on. As far as the shape of the base, it's pretty wide for a short lamp. It came with a light beige lampshade in which I think a white lampshade would have looked better with a gray base.<br /><br />The lampshade measures 9&#34; high and it's fluted with the top measuring 10&#34; wide and the bottom measuring 12&#34; wide. The base (without counting the finial) measures just over 11&#34; high and the widest part measures approx 9&#34; wide.

"Not What You Would Expect,  Especially by the Pictures Shown by Seller: I was initially looking for a journal to use for a Bullet Journal.  This journal type came up as a good idea for people who are left handers so we do not have to fight the spine of normal journals with our hand.  From the picture that the seller provides it looks like a normal black Journalist Type Journal that is very similar to a basic Moleskine or one of the Amazon journals.  I was disappointed upon first arrival as the cover as different than the image that is attached by the seller.  The second disappointment was the fact that the interior of the journal is dated which is very annoying and honestly quite a turn off point for me.  The back pocket was a nice surprise, but I do have to say that overall the entire journal is not that great.  I posted decent pictures so people can see what they are actually buying.

They had the 1988 version with Sesame Street characters, absolutely loved it, and it provided MONTHS of fun, giggles, and motor skill development. At first they were too young to operate all 5 popups, and it was gratifying to see them learn to master all of them as time went on.<br /><br />Another reviewer gave only 3 stars because her child throws it and dents her floors.

"Nice warm light for outdoor use - make sure outlet plug can be seen by remote.: Got these to clip onto a a sun/rain fly over our deck area for use at night now that we can entertain some.  100' string with lights every 2' plus some extra cord for the outlet.  Connect to power supply like a small submergible pump, meaning there are two connection that have to be pushed together and then a rubber seal in place when you screw the cap on the wire.  Power supply plugs into a standard polarized outlet (no third prong) and has a button on it to change light settings.  You pair the remote to this power supply which is why I mention needing it to have line of sight for the remote to work.<br />Remote works well once paired and as long as the power supply is in line of sight.  SInce I doubt you will be changing the lighting every two minutes this is not a big deal but something to keep in mind if the lights do not respond to a settings change.  Speaking of changes, the remote has on/off, (25%, 50%, 75%, & 100%) level presets, a manual brighter and dimmer button, and two modes, one is breathing (brighter to dimmer and back) and the other is flash which is what you would expect.<br />On their brightest setting they are not blinding.  I had all 50 bundled together fresh from the box to pair remote.  Wife had expressed concerns since LED often means bright and a white color.  These as she said, had a warmer almost old time look and they were dim inside relative to normal lighting but would be great outside at night.  In fact on the lowest setting she thought you would still see the lighting bugs off the deck but also be able to see your drink, snack, etc which I took to be high praise.<br />Overall these can be an investment but one I think you will be happy with.  Two spare bulbs are included and life of the bulbs will be defined by usage and also the frequency and amplitude (mentioned in manual) of changing light settings.  Bulbs are weather proof to reasonable limits and durable as well so you do not have to put them up and pull them down every time you want to use them but if left out they should be inspected from time to time to makes sure they are in operational condition.<br />Final thoughts they can be expanded meaning the end of the string has a female plug like the power supply, but I an not sure how many strands you can string together. but probably at least one more then you can control them with one remote.<br /><br />Heading to beach in a month (in a RV at a park) so plan to use these at site with sun/rain fly and I expect they will be perfect for our needs.<br /><br />Thanks for reading",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

"Exciting action romance: Countdown is non-stop action and it's a really great read. As the story begins we meet Kira Jordan, a young woman who's lived as a pickpocket for many years following the brutal murder of her parents. She awakes to find herself in the dark, chained to the wall, with a strange man in the room. That man turns out to be a convicted rapist and multiple murderer, Rogan Ellis, whose actions might be more significant to her than she initially realises.<br /><br />Kira and Rogan are thrust into a series of challenges as part of a giant pay-per-view game where failure means death. The challenges get progressively harder and more bloodthirsty and there's no escape from the game, called Countdown. But as Kira and Rogan work their way through the challenges they learn more about each other and Kira has to begin to learn to trust, despite appearances. But is Countdown more than just a game, might it be even darker than it appears - and can Kira and Rogan escape and prevent something even worse happening?<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, finding it gripping from start to finish and very much enjoying the characters and their personalities. The setting is a post-plague future world in which people work to try to escape Offworld to a new colony and the bleak and often dangerous surroundings in which our hero and heroine find themselves add to the story. There were one or two points within the plot that were just a little too easy or coincidental but overall it was a great read.<br /><br />Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book ¬© Helen Hancox 2008",5.0,Books,1,7

"Warning - One more customer reporting SOLE DELAMINATION after a few years (even without much use): I bought these expensive (for me) boots with high expectations, as in they might last me a lifetime (as I don't do that much hiking).<br /><br />Unfortunately after about five years, I took them for a spin on pavement and BOTH SOLES IMMEDIATELY DELAMINATED, meaning the heel filler turned to sand.  It was a sad trek home with the boot soles loosely flapping against my heels.  Fortunately for me this didn't happen on a mountain!<br /><br />Please note I have taken great care of these boots, always letting them dry naturally in my room and always storing them once dry in the closet.<br /><br />While I wholeheartedly agree with the five-star reviewers regarding fit and comfort, I don't expect *anyhting* I buy for $300 to turn into an unfixable throw-away item by itself after little use.<br /><br />Of course if you are a heavy user likely to wear out these boots before the 5-year heal expiry date :-) then these boots might be perfect for you.<br /><br />Still, as there are many, many other customers with exactly the same complaint about soles delaminating, it would seem there is either a manufacturing problem going on due to low quality raw materials OR the five year heel expiry is a part of a sales-pumping business strategy.<br /><br />The reason I suspect the latter has to do with why I bout these expensive boots in the first place:  Because on my previous hiking boots, a pair of nice Boreal Malis... the heels delaminated as the filler turned to dust!!!  Same story to a ""T"" as with these Asolos, so I decided to move up along the price-point ladder and purchase what seemed to me to be a fancier, better quality item.  So much for my strategy...<br /><br />Disclaimer:  Although I haven't bought my Asolos from Amazon, I feel my caveat emptor feedback might be of use to other potential buyers.<br /><br />Anybody with doubts on my story please feel free to contact me with an email and I will gladly forward you a photo of my delaminated Asolos (and provide you with a photo of the delaminated Boreal Malis for good measure!).",1.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0,10

"A great standalone of a trilogy that did not leave me confused!: I was given this in exchange for an honest review. I haven't read any of the other of the Forbidden Novels, so I was figuring out things as I went. It worked out well because the author actually covered everything in detail so I wasn't lost...I couldn't even tell it was part of a trilogy (I didn't know until after I read it)! Ransom and Dani met in a bar and it wasn't the typical type of hook-up. She was shy and didn't exactly know what she was doing while he was way more experienced and drunk as a skunk! There was a lot of foreplay, but the sex didn't come right away; it was a nice change because in some the foreplay is quick and sex is the main part of the story. This is more of a dealing with issues type of novel. I really enjoyed reading it because there is usually a lot of drama in a relationship (on both sides) that isn't dealt with in books. He was acknowledging that he has a drinking problem and she is helping him to deal with it, as well as the issues he has with his twin brother. In the end, Ransom and Dani are able to work out their relationship at the speed and satisfaction to them both. I highly recommend this book and I am going to go back and read the previous books in the trilogy!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"feels like a plastic bag: I know its vinyl, and I'm sure that it would protect the mattress from liquid just fine, but I don't care for it. This is just my opinion, but it feels (and sounds) like you're laying on one of those cheap plastic covered mattresses in cabins or possibly jail. I'm not returning it, because it will still serve its purpose, and I can kind of get around the negative part. I had to put a peice of foam on top of it, but under the sheet, in order for it to be bearable to lay on. I can still hear the plastic sound, but not near as much, and I don't feel the stiffness of the vinyl under the sheet. So if you want something to protect from liquids that zips up, this one should do the trick (specially for the price), but you may need to put some kind of egg crate or other foam layer on top of it for comfort.

"Works wonderfully and outlasts more expensive brands: I read reviews on many similar products, including NutriBullet and other such name brands.

You can have five great blades but with insufficient power it‚Äôs not going to help. This blender surpasses all those at 200 and 300 watts, with 500 watts. I had hiatal hernia surgery and afterwards this baby was a lifesaver. Every meal went through this blender for a few weeks. No pieces of rubber. And I put room temp, hot, and icy cold foods in it.

"Loving and Hateful Characters, Interesting History, Exciting Adventures: The first thing you'll probably want to know about The Hidden Lifght of Northern Fires is what makes it different enough to read another Civil War saga.  One answer is how well it's written another is how real and heart warming the chraracters are.  Of course the here's lots of partisanship but it's not the focus of the book, even the bad guys are nuanced and some change over the course of the book, almost all of them grow...for better or worse.  There are touching love stories especially the main one is almost worthy of a romance novel.  There are meaningful references to classic literature.  People work hard if that's her won't and some party hard to there detriment.  Everyone in the book is deeply involved in one side or the other and I learned some history I'd never read about prior.<br /><br />I think the cover art is stunning, to me it looks like a detail taken from a Turner painting.  The references to Lincoln are significant but mostly used to say something about the characters' point of view.  Speaking of point of view it's mostly from the two main characters' heads but there are at least two more minor characters whose thoughts we read about.  I like the way Wang illustrates how strong hate can be and how motivating yet how inter mixed with love it often is to the point it's hard to tell the difference but back to my main premise...Hidden is significant and different enough to hold your attention and since, like me, you're interested enough in the history of this time and place o read a few reviews by other addicts I'd say Hidden is well worth your time.<br /><br />4.5/5 stars",4.0,Books,1,7

"No leaks!: I am a mother of 7 under the age of 10 so I feel like I know a little bit more than the average person about diapers. First, what I like... they don‚Äôt leak. These hold up overnight even if my baby takes a bottle to bed. I feel like a diaper isn‚Äôt a bargain if I‚Äôm constantly changing outfits and washing sheets. They are also thin. The honest diapers looked like my baby had a huge diaper right after I changed them. These don‚Äôt. They are soft. No chaffing no scratchy tabs. Also, the tabs stick really well. Sometimes it can be a pain during a 3 am diaper change but I know they are secure. And none of my kids have had any rashes with these. What I don‚Äôt like... when my child pees the inside of the diaper feels like clumpy wet cotton and it can hang down. I am not a first time mom who can follow their baby around and change them every wet diaper so sometimes there can be 2 or 3 pees in there. But... all in all I would recommend because they don‚Äôt leak and no rashes and that what‚Äôs most important to me.",4.0,Baby_Products,1,5

Easier than the factory charger: This is a nice looking charger for the Fitbit Ionic tracker.  It is much easier to use than the charger included with the Ionic.  That was a challenge because even after you get the charger and tracker mated together you need to be very careful about setting it down so is doesn't come apart and not charge.  This one you just drop your Ionic in the cradle and you're good to go.<br /><br />The only negatives I see are that is will take a little bit of counter space and it will need to be dusted.  It is also a little challenging getting the display to come on to see what charging level it is at since the button is pretty well contained in the charger.  That containment is also a benefit since it holds the Ionic firmly in place for charging.,5.0,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,1,9

"We make our own luck; we drown in our own grief...: First a disclaimer: I'm a sucker for second chance tales. But even by that standard, Hogan's book is refreshing. It takes a long time to flesh out Masha. The slowness didn't bother me because I was so often focused on Hogan's strong wordsmithing. She can be lyrical (in an economic way) one minute and drop-dead snarky the next. (Both Masha and Hogan have gallows humor.) The slowness of the first third of the book is perfectly in keeping with Masha's stage of development. Still thrall to grief, she's closed off from her nearest and dearest. So why would she open herself to us readers with any speed, either? The pace picks up as Masha struggles out of the prison of her own making and interacts with more and more of the quirky characters in her life, not least of all Sally the loony feeder of crows. I don't see Sally as the catalyst for Masha's recovery, any more than any of the other friends were. But Sally feeds the Leitmotif of grief. Grief over a lost loved one is what landed Sally in her dysfunctional state. This is where Masha is headed, unless....<br /><br />The parallel tale of two other characters spins out separately from Masha's story. Halfway through the novel it's easy to guess how the two sets of characters will intersect. That's not a criticism. This is a literary novel, not a mystery.<br /><br />The miraculous insertion of that second group of characters into the chief protagonist's life rounds the circle of Masha's evolution, but is not the reason for it. What I most liked about the book is that Masha did the hard work all by herself -- yeah, with a little help from her friends, but she had to struggle to see the lifelines around her and finally grab onto them. She had to start swimming in that cold pool and stop her ghoulish drowning experiments in it.

"Looks Nice in My Kithchen Window: I am super happy with these simple swags. The color is more of a yellow, sorta like eggnog - as another reviewer pointed out, - and the color matches my decor exactly so I am pleased. The fabric texture is fine especially for the price. I didn't notice any imperfections. In fact, the quality is better than I anticipated. Plus, these swags are stiffer and do not droop, which is great because I didn't want fabric that would droop down. I have to say, the tiered shaping makes my tall, rectangular kitchen window look nice! Anyhow, these swags worked out well for my needs.<br /><br />By the way, my kitchen window is 34 inches wide (inside windowsill measurement), and I used a 7/16-Inch Diameter Spring Tension Rod to hang these curtains.

"ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD...: Written by master storyteller Anya Seton, this book tells the story of Amanda Lawrence, a young, well educated woman, whose family lost their fortune in the stock market crash of 1929. Pursued by the wealthy and cosmopolitan Tim Merrill, a member of the smart set of young people with whom she associates, she throws him over, to his and everyone's surprise, for Jonathan Dartland. Known as ""Dart"", he is a young mining engineer who straddles two worlds, that of his half-breed Apache mother, and that of his Harvard educated father, scion of a prominent New England family.<br /><br />Dart and Amanda marry and move to a rough, depression era mining town called Lodestone. There, she meets a motley cast of characters and discovers what roughing it really means. Both she and Dart have issues that they must overcome or with which they must come to grips before either can find happiness in their marriage. The hardships of living in poverty in a depression era mining town take their toll on the relationship. Moreover, hidden jealousies at the mine impact on Dart's career.<br /><br />These two lovers then find themselves torn apart by feelings about which neither of them speak. Together, they join with the mine's doctor, the bitter and always drunk Doctor Slater, and go off on an expedition to find a hidden mine. These intrepid explorers seek gold in hopes of attaining their individual dreams. Instead, they are be brought to the brink of death and despair. Yet, Amanda and Dart would find something that they thought had been beyond their grasp.<br /><br />This novel is not one of Ms. Seton's better efforts. Though some of it is interesting, in terms of depression era life in a mining town, this book did not age particularly well, having a faint anachronistic feel to it. Still, fans of Ms. Seton may find a modicum of enjoyment in reading it.",3.0,Books,0,7

"These are my favorite coasters: These are my favorite coasters.  I love how they look and absorb water from my large overly iced coffees and waters.  I have bought these coaster sets on multiple occasions and given them as gifts to those that have complemented my sets.  They work great for hot/cold beverages.<br /><br />If the surface becomes overly wet from a forgotten beverage, I simply wipe it dry with an absorbent tea towel and let it dry out for the day/night.<br /><br />As expected, theses coasters can be considered fragile if they are misused or dropped on hard surfaces.  Use common senses.  If overly heavy objects are placed on them, harsh cleansers are used, someone pokes at them with a sharp utensil, or you place them on uneven-hard surfaces for some reason, the surface and/or edges can show wear and possibly chip.<br /><br />One of these coasters survived an unexpected fall unscathed.

"Super cheap, but low quality: Compared to my Parker Sonnet (which is much more expensive to be fair) this feels really cheap. Its extremely light, has a very loud click that doesnt feel very smooth, and the ink cartridge has some play and moves a little when your writing.<br /><br />As others have noticed, the embossing in the metal is barely visible, doesnt look really good.<br /><br />It was a cheap pen and im sure its nice to say you have a parker, but i wouldnt be proud of this pen whatsoever. For the same price you can get a lesser known brand that is better quality.<br /><br />What im trying to say is that a $100 Parker Sonnet is awesome, but a $10 Jotter is truly not. For your $10 you can get a better quality Zebra. Parker would be wiser to save their name and not enter the super cheapo market with such a low quality item, they missed the mark.<br /><br />If all you care about is owning a Parker, go ahead and get it so you can put it in storage somewhere. If your gonna show it off or use it heavily, just go get a Zebra. 3 stars because its such a low price, but so far below the standards of a nice Parker pen.<br /><br />If i was told it was a fake, i would believe it.",3.0,Office_Products,0,24
"A good start at addressing other-language awareness in the US: This book does a good job of calling attention to, examining and exemplifying the problem of language discrimination in the United States. This is of course very positive as far as it goes. I have, however, a few minor comments on how this study might have gone further:<br /><br />(1) The author doesn't discuss the issue of varying levels of intelligibility of accents. All accents are not created equal. Some are easier to understand, others present real comprehension problems. For example, an accent that has consistent vowel values (say, a French or Swedish accent) tends to be easier to understand than one with unpredictable vowel values (some varieties of Chinese English, such as Taiwan English, are notorious for this, and can be quite difficult to follow). Non-Englishlike prosody, e.g. failing to stress new and important information, but then putting stress on less important function words like ""to"" and ""her"",  can really confuse a listener. And the more of a burden you put on the listener, the less patience you can expect from them.<br /><br />(2) I disagree with the author that European accents are ""never"" the target of discrimination. You find them made fun of in all kinds of 19th and 20th century literature, e.g. Sinclair Lewis's _Main Street_ (which parodies immigrant German and Swedish accents in Minnesota in the 1910s). Notably, it is farmers and other humble folk who are often the targets of such parodies.<br /><br />The author is thus right in zeroing in on *power* relations as the key issue, probably even more than intelligibility. We are less willing to work hard to understand someone who is viewed as less powerful than ourselves or the group we identify with, and tend to be more patient with those we look up to.<br /><br />For a bit of perspective, think of the deference and patience many of us will show when listening to Stephen Hawking ""speaking"" through his synthesizer, though this kind of speech is considerably more unnatural and difficult to process than many foreign accents. We're less willing to work as hard when someone seems less worthwhile and more expendable to us. A very simple principle, but its roots are deep and ramifications far-reaching.<br /><br />(3) This book fails to address the *reasons* for the typical US lack of empathy toward and interest in not just foreigners, but anyone who is too different from the mainstream. We learn to shun or fear differentness, and to deal with it by avoiding any reference to it, hiding from it, trying to pretend it's not there. This is *not* the way to bridge relations between two groups prone to mutual misunderstanding. I suggest that comedian Russell Peters' head-on approach is much more effective - and fun.<br /><br />(4) I would classify this book more as persuasive discourse rather than an objective study. The advantage of this is a consistent point of view and stand on the main issues - additionally justified by the author's being on the side of ""right"". The drawback is that this kind of work is unlikely to voice any defense of the other side, and it thus glosses over deeper issues, e.g. the *reasons* behind language discrimination. Lippi-Green adopts a rather emotional tone in her presentation, communicating a feeling of ""Isn't this outrageous? How can we allow this?! It must stop!"" Fair enough, but besides not delving into where the attitudes come from, neither does she suggest viable, practical ways that might help improve the situation.<br /><br />I offer two possible starting points:<br /><br />(1) Foreign language education should be vastly strengthened in the US. Students should be given the feeling that speaking another language is important, highly useful in the real world, and something to be admired. They should themselves experience the feeling of someone else calling the shots and giving them funny feedback when they don't express themselves very aptly or gracefully. Being in the other guy's shoes is a powerful way of generating understanding and true empathy, and fostering patience.<br /><br />(2) Immigrants and other foreign language speakers should be treated by teachers and other adults as the treasure chests they are of information about a different way of living, talking and thinking. If they were often presented and viewed as people with something genuinely interesting and ""cool"" to offer, children would certainly be more empathic to their viewpoints and also to the style of English they speak.<br /><br />These are just two possibilities. With so, so many people from other cultures and language groups now living in the US, I hope that this important issue gets more of the attention it deserves, in the form of more books like this, but also in the whole education system, the media, and all of society. This book opens the door a crack. We need to push it wide open, enter the room, and start taking substantive action to effect meaningful change.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Essential.: I own the Collected Works of Victor Hugo, 15 vols. Last summer I found the time to read all of them. I must say that The Toilers of the Sea, in the end, strikes me as the best book Hugo ever wrote. Sure, we have The Hunchback of Notre Dame. And Les Miserables. But Toilers of the Sea got to me more, okay? Somehow I identified with Gilliat more than with Quasimodo and Jean Valjean combined. He's a very realistic character, unlike the overly miserable hunchback or the overly saintly Valjean, and his struggles are very realistic, which makes the reader care far more about whether he succeeds or not.<br />Hugo had spent some years in Jersey/Guernsey, where the book takes place, and I suppose that observing the sea was all there was to do there, since in the book it's clear that he knows every little aspect of it. The sea is just as prominent a character as Gilliat, and just as realistic, and has even more space devoted to it than any of the humans. It's hard to think of it as inanimate after reading this book. The imagery of the storm is certainly unforgettable.<br />This book is more touching than Hugo's others, maybe because the author focuses more on telling a story rather than a Big Important Social Message About the Plight of the Poor. There's humor, there's tragedy, there's drama, and the result is a very immersive read.",5.0,Books,1,7

"We have more than we need: If they learned to smile the whole day, then America must be the happiest place on earth. And that, is the title of her next essay: ‚ÄòThe Happiest Place on Earth‚Äô. She draws on her trip to Disneyland with her children and there realised how fake and delusional the experience in Disneyland can make a person without him even knowing it. ‚ÄòThe semi-hypnotic state of helplessness is central to the experience of Disney. Havrilesky rips open the true meanings not only of an experience at Disneyland but also the words in the brochures they give out there. ‚ÄòWhen you enter Disneyland, you will find yourself in a land of yesterday, tomorrow, and fantasy‚Äô. She points out that the brochure itself admits, ‚ÄòNothing of the present exists in Disneyland‚Äô. Havrilesky‚Äôs book sets out to get us to live in the present, not artificially happy, nor be weighed by despair, but to admit of both in such measures as life throws at us, and learn resilience and fortitude, and the wisdom react appropriately.<br /><br /> She has essays on infinity and things we keep. The latter one (‚ÄòStuffed‚Äô) provides a deeper insight into the work of Marie Kondo, the guru of chucking out things. Havrilesky shows a sense of humour, asking what would Kondo think about people throwing out their things only to add another of her books (she has at least two) to their shelves. The important question is not whether your stuff sparks joy (as Kondo suggests) but whether you can ‚Äòspark joy all by yourself?‚Äô as Havrilesky suggests.<br /><br /> She writes about bravado and laments that we no longer appreciate the capable but ‚Äòprefer to celebrate the valiant, charismatic leader who speaks confidently of his vision of what should come next. We don‚Äôt always care who is doing the concrete work to which his grand gestures allude‚Äô. Throughout most of all her essays is the recurrent theme of the evil of keeping up with appearances in polite society. Without claiming as much, this book is, ultimately, a wonderful book of authenticity and existentialism.",5.0,Books,1,7

"I'm truly disappointed in this product and wish I'd never purchased it: I have lost so much vision, I have to pay a bi-monthly housekeeper. But I needed something in between, to clean the living room dinette, and family room floors. Based on the reviews, I bought the 650, one of the biggest and most expensive mistakes I've made. Most of my floors are hardwood, with some vinyl. The Rumba does not clean this very well. I know, because I walk on them barefoot. The Roomba bounces off whatever it contacts, changes direction and goes until it bounces off something else. This is its &#34;random&#34; pattern. So it cleans those paths very well and doesn't touch anything it doesn't bounce to. It has chewed off a little of a bathroom baseboard, in a tight corner, bouncing from the tub to the wall. And for those who say it picks up a lot, check your carpets. I have only two, both oriental, in my living room. We are seldom in there, yet the bin is full. Based on that, I suspect it is eating my carpet pile. Now I'm trying to keep it out of the rooms where I have the rugs, and confine it to the kitchen/family room area.

"Good, not great.: Product looks as described in the picture and came with everything shown. The quality of the plastic appears good for the price, however in most cases the lids did not comfortable connect to the body of the containers (the containers sides caved in a bit forcing me to pull them outwards so that the lid would fit in. All of the snapping mechanisms, including the pouring port are tight and seem very secure. The pour out of this thing is very satisfying... it's large and the cereal does not collect or bunch up trying to get out which is nice over previous cereal containers I've owned.<br /><br />Even with the lid on and snapped, however, it just doesn't seem like it has the best airtight seal. It looks as though it has the gaskets, but the way the lid goes on makes it feel like the body is just touching the gaskets and not actually creating a seal with them. It remains to be seen just how fresh this keeps my cereal.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have is that the listed dimensions are off. The claimed width of the product is 3.35"" which appears to be the width of the body and does not take into account the extra width that the locking snaps on the lid take. I was expecting the six of these to easily fit on a 24 inch shelf but they do not. The actual width of the container with the lid on and secured is about 4.3"". As a self-professed pack rat, I can tell you that this misrepresentation completely throws off my pantry plans and is very nearly unforgivable. Now I probably have to buy a new house just to make these fit properly.<br /><br />Anyway, as long as your aware of what you're getting, you should be able to plan accordingly.

"""The Real On Social Media"": This is the first novel that I have read by Jordan Belcher, and I am ready to read another one.<br /><br />[ALERT!!!...No Spoiler Alert!! This review will not ruin it for those who haven't read it yet!!!]<br /><br />THE STORY IS ABOUT A WOMAN WHO GETS CAUGHT UP IN A SOCIAL MEDIA SITE CALLED &#34;THE SITE&#34; [EQUIVALENT TO FACEBOOK].  IT DETAILS ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD GO RIGHT AND GO WRONG WHEN YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES!!<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: If you are into or curious about social media, it is a MUST-READ!!<br /><br />It was a good read and long overdue!  The world, especially the youth, need to see what life CAN BECOME when they spend all of there time on social media sites...posting there lives and every move for the world to see.<br /><br />I was able to connect to the characters and the raw emotions they felt on this journey through life, not because I have been thru it but because Belcher laid the ground-work.  It was realistic and encouraging...relevant and catching...necessary and deeply appreciated!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book gets 4 stars, instead of 5, because it was , at times, a bit toooo far-fetched.  However, it wasn't enough to make me put the book down.  For the most part, the action packed twists and turns added the &#34;page-tuner&#34; effect that I so thoroughly enjoy when I read a novel. I kept turning and turning....before I knew it I was finished the book. I'm an e-Reader now so I could peek at the next page before I actually got to it but I did have to resist the urge to tab to the next page a few times. And the fact that it wasn't totally predictable was FABULOUS!!!<br /><br />I READ THE BOOK IN A DAY!<br />BUY IT....READ IT....REVIEW IT!!<br /><br />4 Stars From Me!!<br /><br />Status 2....Here I Come!!!<br />Peace & Writers Blessings!<br /><br />--Blessed Book Critic",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

The book did slow down a little in the middle with the flashbacks retelling their summers together. I loved the bonus content of the recipes and how the talk of food was seamless in the book. That shows that the author clearly did her research.",4.0,Books,1,7

Improperly heat treated. Metal is still soft! Not durable!: The attached picture shows one pass though 1/4 inch mild steel.

"Some improvement over its predecessor: I bought this to tape OTA broadcasts after my previous Homeworx HW130 STB failed to power on.  This is the updated successor which, thankfully, has the power supply built in and uses a standard 2 conductor AC (US standard - here) plug.  Interestingly, it has component, composite, RG6 and RCA coax legacy connectors.  I really can't  see how they omitted s-video jacks, but I digress.  Of course, I used HDMI to connect to my set.<br /><br />This box is not compatible with the old remote and, of course, they changed the button layout.  The software is just as awkward as the previous box and the new box seems to be slightly less sensitive.  Picture quality and sonics are good.  It ""saw"" the 1TB external HD that I've  been using to time shift without any problem.  All in all, good stuff.<br /><br />It turned out that the old power supply brick died on the old unit.  After an extensive search through my old electronica, I was able to find a 5V 2A power supply with a right sized barrel connector.  I now have 2 working OTA time shifters.  Too bad I spend too much screen time as it is.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

Great Game for Magic School Bus Lovers: You are going on a field trip to the beach with the Magic School Bus Class. You look in the water and find a treasure map. You have to get the answers to the three questions in order to find the treasure. Along the way  you can explore each zone of the ocean and play fun games that earn you  fish cards. It is hard to get all the fish cards and I haven't even done it  yet but I've started the second page. You can even print out your fish  cards. Kids will have a lot of fun exploring the ocean and learning about  sea life. You can also see animations by just clicking on a picture. This  is a very easy game to use and I think you should buy it. If you don't  you're missing out on something great.,5.0,Video_Games,1,33

"Murder, Missing Manuscript, Another Murder: Set in North Devon, England we encounter Kat Stanford as she is trying to establish her new antique business.  She is quickly pulled into the antics of her mother Iris and Uncle Alfred. What appears to be an initial mystery of an uncovered skeleton turns into a manuscript not being sent in to a robbery and then another murder.  This all happens while the town is trying to prepare for the Skirmish festivities.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the historical aspects of the book.  This includes the research on the family history to the details on the family portraits as well as the church.  I also appreciate the amount of work it takes to properly put on the Skirmish.<br /><br />While a quick read, at times I was struggling with which plotline was the mystery that was being solved, or if one was being solved at all.  The author did a nice job in the end to tie everything together, which was no small task with so many moving pieces.<br /><br />This is the fourth book in the series, and the first one that I read.  While I was able to read this book as a standalone, I think I would have picked up on some of the references much faster if I had read the others first.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"A Tour de Force: Puleo's book is a virtuoso manual on the mentality and values in both North and South which led to the Civil<br />War.  In the South goodness was maintained and enforced by an aristocracy of planters who were supported by the common(white) man.  In the North goodness was the responsibility and the possession of the demos, the mass of white men, who were in principle morally equal.  In the South some men(the gentlemen planters) claimed to posssess a superior transcendent morality and the right to maintain it.  Each side positively clanked with self-righteousness.  Charles Sumner became the poster boy of victimhood when Preston Brooks beat him almost to death.  Brooks became the embodiment of the enforcer of righteousness when he chastised Sumner his vituperative calumnies against those who represented transcendent moral principle.  Puleo doesn't just describe this conflict of notions he demonstrates their realities in North a South.  A profound book!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"What was the underlying true motivation for writing this book?: Nicholas Wade is not a scientist, neither an efficient reader of data, let alone history. To advance that African- Americans are more violent than White Folks, with a reference to Jewische people as most obsessed with capitalism and more of such nonsense, all derived from, or based on a genome is a display of sublime ignorance. Is there a possibility Mr Wade may learn about the 2014 years of the Holy Roman Empire which continues to shape the world we are forced to live in? Capitalism is this institution Summum Bonum/highest good, unfortunately not a la Cicero, with Child Abuse sold as education for more than a century as its latest achievement; its obsession with indoctrination as education without substance. There is no greater criminal institution where no laws appear applicable, to those who hold the power with very little melanin in the skin: has Mr Wade any genome explanation for the cruelty from the Vatican?

I would have been better off paying full price on the Norton site.<br /><br />Update: I was able to install the software. Just be aware that the Amazon software downloader tool is NOT needed for Windows 8. It is needed for other versions of Windows. It was actually fairly easy to download once I figured out the process for 8 is different.<br />I added it to my iOS as well. Pretty simple. It backs up my contacts and has security if the phone is stolen. I'm not sure what else it does.,4.0,Software,1,27

"Should be Required Listening...: For some reason, Canada seems to have an extraordinary wealth of highly talented musicians, artists and songwriters. Maybe it's those cold winters and the tendency to gather around the kitchen table and trade songs on those cold winter nights. Not sure.<br /><br />James Keelaghan is one of those artists and his body of work is about as good as it gets, with a resonant baritone reminiscent of Stan and Garnet Rogers, and an ability to write great songs, often with an historical perspective, that will make your heart swell. This is the guy who wrote ""Cold MIssouri Waters"", about the Mann Gulch Fire of 1949. One of the most moving songs I've ever heard.<br /><br />Some of these songs are going to become classics. Safe Home is a simple tune but it is one that stays with you after the last note falls silent. McConnville's is a gentle but moving tale of friendship.  The title song, House of Cards, should be required listening in every business school in North America and beyond.<br /><br />Check out this artist's other albums and live performances as well...you'll become a fan.",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Worth getting!: Easy to use.  Just set the dial on the air pump to the desired pressure.  It will inflate until the desired pressure is reached and automatically stop.  This high pressure (capable of up to 20 PSI), electric air pump is much faster and more convenient than using a manual, dual action hand pump to inflate my inflatable kayak.  It takes me less than 10 minutes to fully inflate or deflate my kayak using this electric air pump.  This electric air pump can either be plugged into/powered from your vehicle's 12-Volt cigarette lighter or from your vehicle battery terminals with alligator clips adapter that is included.  Just make sure to keep your vehicle running to prevent draining down your vehicle battery when using the air pump.  My preference is to connect it and power it from vehicle battery which allows for better reach when inflating my kayak.  Keep in mind that the two types of connection adapters for the air hose are made for air valves with Stern, Boston, and Halkey-Roberts type fittings found on inflatable kayaks and inflatable stand up paddleboards (iSUPs).",5.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Great Movie: This is undoubtedly one of the most original and one of the best action movies around.  I first saw it when I was 15 and though I thought it was a little wierd and disturbing at the time, I just couldn't help liking it.  I still like it today, too.  After Mel Gibson's wife is killed, he just goes after her murderers and is total merciless!  The most memorable scene, to me, is the one where Max handcuffs one of the killers to a car, rigs it to explode, and then gives the guy a hacksaw, saying something like &quot;You've got five minutes to live.  You could cut threw the handcuffs in ten.  You could probably cut threw your wrist in 4.&quot;  That is such a cool scene!<br />Anyway, I wasn't going to write a review of this film until I read the review under mine.  The one written by Mark Dewey from Australia.  At the end of his review he says &quot;USA We're with you Sept. 11 2001&quot;, and, being someone who was deeply affected by the attacks, that just warmed my heart and made me smile with thanks knowing that even someone from the other side of the globe is supporting us.

"Super great for camping!: I have used this lewis N Clark Eye Mask for over a year now to give it a fair review.<br /> Lewis N Clark makes a great product here!<br />My initial need was for bike camping trips. Primarily to keep the 4:30 am sun from waking me too soon.  Worked great! Eye mask paired with a set of earplugs made sleeping in campgrounds super relaxing and providing a full nights sleep.<br />I then began to use the mask at home. Again, same reason, blocking out the morning sun and partners reading lamp.<br />The mask stays on very well and gives complete darkness. There are slight pillows under the eyes to help block light from seeping in. This was a great design for a successful mask in my opinion.<br />As far as feel goes. The mask is super soft!

"Poor Chinese Copy of a much better pipette: This is a Chinese made clone of the German made Brand Accu-Jet Pro. You'll find tons of these branded under a range of names from Walter to FisherSci. In fact Fisher Scientific has a disclaimer on their site stating that this pipette has nothing to do with the Brand Accu-Jet (I'm assuming lawyers were involved).  You can tell the Chinese knock-offs apart from the Brand controllers by the groove features on the handles (the Brand handles are smooth) and by the slightly fatter neck next to the nozzle.<br />  The blatancy of the copying is downright impressive. I've taken the two units apart, and the left half of the body shell from the Chinese made controller literally snaps onto the right half of the body shell from the German controller, (except for the slight mismatch at the neck where some changes were made).  I don't see how a copy that exact could be made with out access to the engineering files used in making the original. Even more egregious is the fact that the manual that comes with this pipette controller is plagiarized from German made unit, and has poorly scanned in photos that show the German unit in it.<br />  The problem is that blind copying, without knowledge of the designers intent, leads to a crappy product.  The pump used in this unit is cheaper, and jerkier. The silicon molding which goes into making the pneumatic trigger valves and the elastic nozzle socket that holds the serological pipettes is simply inferior. This translates into valves that are not nearly as responsive, especially at slow speeds, and will occasionally stick and leak, and a nozzle socket that doesn't hold the pipettes as securely as the original. So where the proverbial tire meets the road, this unit is sliding around on rims. They did however upgrade the NMh battery pack to a LiPo battery to save on some weight, and potentially improve battery life, for what that's worth.<br />  To summarize, given that the Brand Accu-Jet Pro's list price is right around 400 USD, you might be tempted into buying something that looks for all intents and purposes identical to it at 1/3 the price; but it's probably not worth it.  This is essentially the Harbor Freight version. Probably fine if you only need to use it once in a long while, but if pipetting is at all central to your work, get the real McCoy.<br /><br />(this review is identical to other listings of the same product)",2.0,Unknown,0,32

Exactly what I expected and needed.: This was exactly what I was hoping for. Very well built metal rack. Perfect for my home gym and smaller weights. I use 3lbs up to 20lbs. Very sturdy and solid.

"yea!!!: I love this vest. I bought it as a under-coat layer for when it's cold and the coat that you like to wear just isn't really warm enough. It's really great as a layering item. I then bought another one, one size larger to fit OVER my coat when it's really chilly; love this as it gives you options. I can't say it looks great; just ok but I bought it for other reasons. I'm flat chested so I had no problem with the fit and if anything wish the bust was a tad smaller, but if you're very full breasted it might be an issue. Also: I sometimes wear it around the house if it's chilly inside. I give this a big A+ though it's a tad expensive. I wear it so much though; worth the extra $$.

"Christie-Inspired Mystery: You can really tell where Conroy got her inspiration for this one. The book screams Hercule Poirot, the ending especially (don't worry, you don't see it coming). I have a soft spot for Agatha Christie-like murder intrigue and the premise of A Testament to Murder felt just like that. You know, the multiple people gathered together, someone dies, everyone could have a motive type deal.<br /><br />The part that fell flat for me, however, was the character development. They didn't really feel like real people as much as pawns to move the plot forward. They didn't respond to situations in ways that felt genuine and they were kind of interchangeable personality wise.<br /><br />Sometimes it also felt like there was a little too much exposition and like Conroy was trying to stuff too many words into a sentence. And, totally a personal pet peeve here, but most scenes with dialogue went like:<br />He said, ""words"". Instead of ""Words,"" he said. I'm OK with that for a few lines, but it feels kind of jarring<br /><br />All in all a good cozy mystery with enough intrigue and twists to keep you interested. I just wanted it to be a bit more charming.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Nice bean bag chair, but the price is overrated.: I really really wanted to LOVE this product as first of all we can always use extra seating in our large family full of kids and teens, secondly it looked, from the product page, to be a full, large bean bag chair that did seem to have the seating availability I needed as well as being tall and super fluffy. Combin that with memory foam stuffing and I was hooked as I figured that would be so much better than normal bean bag stuffing that relatively sagged after a while and you had to manually &#34;fluff&#34; up.<br /><br />So when I got this in I was surprised at the heavy weight, and then at the really small box. But upon opening the package you'll find the bean bag chair nicely zipped in a bag that really does seem like high quality. It was hard to get the zipper open due to the memory foam so I let my husband tackle that while I opened the outer casing. We knew to quickly insert the stuffing as once expanded it seemed like it would be hard to put it on, and the instructions do say it would take 24 hours to fully fluff out. With high expectations I viewed it the next day kind of sadly. While still a beautiful grey color and having a really great feeling fabric, the thickness was still not there. Or at least it didn't look like the picture. Now over 24 hours later i can fully say the bean bag chair is wide. Which will provide a lot of room for kids, adults, etc to sit on. But as for the height or firmness, it is definitely lacking! It looks nothing like the firmness of the picture but instead is pretty floppy. Again quality is outstanding, the fabric is great, it does have an easy open zipper for cleaning, especially since the fabric casing isn't tight on the memory foam at all, and the memory foam is pretty comfy. If your a small person. My husband sat on it and he is 220 pounds and he can feel the floor through it. However I fit fine and it keeps me comfy but I'm a small individual.<br /><br />In all I do like the product, but I can't see it for the price. It is comfortable, but lacks that firmness that tells me it will last for a long while. And a last note being that it is memory foam, which means when you get up the memory foam does stay in the position you left it so you have to perk or fluff it up again.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br /><br />I did give this a three star rating as it wasn't as big or stayed fluffy...but now that my infant daughter is older, she wants to &#34;sit up&#34; to eat her bottle, and I found it a little difficult to get both of us comfortable until I eyed the bean bag chair in the corner.  Needless to say, I don't use her expensive rocker, the sofa, or any other chair in the house to feed her, but this one!  It makes me have the perfect angle to feed her where we're both comfy, and she even loves to sit in the hole I made by sitting myself in it before placing her in the chair.  From that angle she can watch her cartoons easily while I sit next to her on the floor, and she's totally happy!  So it may be overpriced, but considering this bean bag is the only chair that works for us, I amend my three star rating, and give it a four.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"3 Week International Trip - Didn't Hold Up As Well As Expected: We bought this two pack, hoping they'd be sturdier than many of the other luggage tags we've had the misfortune of dealing with.  Solid aluminum, coated steel cable - they've got to be sturdy, right?  Well, kind of.  We just got back from a 3 week trip through Asia, which included 11 flights &amp; 4 train rides (yes, we get around).  One tag made it back with a decent bit of damage.  The other didn't make it back at all.<br /><br />The first one has a few creases in it where it was obviously bent in transit.  This in no way makes it unusable, just a little ugly.  I do think that any additional force on one of the creases will most likely cause it to break on that line.<br /><br />The second one disappeared during a flight - obviously ripped off by the luggage handling equipment at the airport.  This one really surprised us.  The cable that holds these on seemed plenty strong, and is plastic coated (to prevent scratches &amp; rust).  We had joked that the bag's handle would break off before the cable did.  In retrospect, I guess it's good that we were wrong - I'd definitely rather lose a $3 luggage tag than the handle on a $100 suitcase.<br /><br />So these are good luggage tags, and will probably serve a light traveler well for years.  Then again, so would most other tags.  But for those of us who travel rather heavily, they're probably not quite as good as you're hoping when you see the design.",2.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0,10

"The plastic ""crystal"" scratches very easily. I've had other watches for years and they ...: This is an issue with Swatches in general. The plastic &#34;crystal&#34; scratches very easily. I've had other watches for years and they look fine, except for maybe a few scratches that you can only see in the light held from certain angles. Within a week of getting this I reached behind a desk (not roughly) and the watch made contact with the wall and left relatively large scuffs on the plastic that were white because of the wall's paint. With a little buffing the scuffs became less distracting and I got the paint out, but they are still quite evident .<br /><br />On the upside I do like the styling, it hits the right spot between low key and loud for me. Also the silicone band is very comfortable.<br /><br />If I could go back I'd probably get something with a proper crystal. I've kept my other watches for years, but I could see myself getting rid of this after a year, or sooner, if it gets more beat up.",3.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,0,10

"Colossal success or colossal failure?: What should be said about a book that is supposed to be a satire on pretentiousness and becomes pretentious itself?  Either it's a great success or a colossal failure.<br /><br />First, it must be pointed out that this is a work of fiction.  Sloin does such an excellent job of creating the sense that this is a biography that readers and others are constantly confused as to what it is. The book succeeded at winning an award for nonfiction until it was pointed out that the story is pure fiction.<br /><br />This is not a book for someone who wants a leisurely entertaining reading experience.  It takes effort to get through this book.  The story can't be consumed by itself because the reader is distracted by the footnotes and commentary that are sprinkled through it.  Even while you tell yourself that these items are manufactured by Sloin, they seem realistic and beg to be read.  Often the real points of the book are expressed in these notes and not in the story.  Francesca's story is second place to the observations that are made in the notes.  Sometimes that's a blessing because Francesca is the type of character a reader wants to shake and tell to wake up to real life.  Then again her whole family is composed that way.  In the end Francesca deSilva is a pathetic character.  What makes her life noteworthy is her paintings and they don't survive her, so there is a feeling of a waste of a life and a waste of effort to tell about that life.<br /><br />Sloin uses the book to make some strong statements.  In the footnotes she takes jabs at the art community as she manufactures experts to give manufactured opinions.  She also attacks segments of the gay and lesbian community. It almost seems that Sloin wanted to write a commentary about the gay/lesbian and art communities, but thought that would be ignored, so she decided that the way to get attention was to write them into a story.  The result of that is a disjointed reading experience as the reader is tossed from the story to the footnotes and back again.<br /><br />Art on Fire has drawn attention and won some awards.  Other reviews range all over trying to decide if its mastery is as a quasi-biography (although fictional), a satire on the artistic community or a complex, intricate novel.  Sometimes a book, play or movie is written that people can't really comprehend, but the feeling is that it's because you're just not smart enough.  If you just had a little more insight, you would see the ""beauty"" of the work yourself.  If that isn't the epitome of pretentiousness, what is?  Sometimes the emperor really isn't wearing any clothes.",3.0,Books,0,7

I bought a hard one that snaps on the front and back and that did very little for protecting.<br /><br />But this Click On case is the best I've used in a long time. For any phone. Just click it on the back and that's it. It feels comfortable and doesn't cover the entire phone, just keys areas (the sides and corners), so your Evo still has some breathing room.

"An Important Account of the Gulag: This is a very well written account of the author's experiences in Soviet prison camps, at an earlier point in the development of the Gulag.  The author was arrested in 1928, in a period that marked the start of the expansion of the Gulag.  It is important to realize that as the thirties progressed, conditions in the Gulag became much worse, and the population increased with waves of mass arrests and deportations.  Combined with the starvation diet, hard labor and lack of medical care, the death rate in the camps during late thirties increased exponentially.  It is likely that the author would not have been released or survived had he been arrested a few years later.  The author's perspective gives a glimpse of a Westerner's reaction to the emerging brutality of Stalinism, with its arrest quotas, corruption and warped judiciary system.  The author was fortunate to have been released, but he died in England shortly after being freed.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

I went with yellow after considering orange.  The color ring snaps very securely into the wheel cover.  They fit tight and seem very durable.  They were packaged very well and took less than 30 mins to assemble and install all 4.  He gets asked a lot where he bought them and has referred a few of his friends to OMAC.

FINAL SEASON NOT RELEASED IN BLURAY: The show is awesome and I love that the writers have given us 2 series that have a satisfying ending ... What I'm livid about is I purchased both the Vampire Diaries and The Originals in bluray format and for the final season they decided not to release it in bluray that's just wrong it looks so awkward on the shelf with the rest of 2 series I'm very unhappy about that I have sent messages to Warner Archives of course no reply as of yet they could have at least included a digital code so we could watch it in HD on VUDU or wherever.

"Fascist Garbage: I should start out by saying that a) I have never seen the movie and b) as an army veteran in a militia state (Switzerland), I should presumably be receptive to one of the (supposedly) core ideas in _Starship Troopers_, that citizenship has to be earned by public service. Unfortunately, Heinlein seems to have very little use for the actual *exercise* of the citizenship: His characters refer to it on derogatory terms, all of them get killed or become career soldiers rather than voting citizens, and none of them evidences the slightest interest in actually *changing* anything in this oh-so-perfect society.<br />Instead, we get treated to a view of a society which constantly brutalizes its members from childhood through military training to their slaughter in poorly motivated military tactics and to justify it all, harangues them in regular indoctrination lectures. Blatantly taking a page out of the Nazi playbook, the instructors keep referring to their poorly reasoned apologies for their brutal ideology as &quot;exact science&quot; and &quot;mathematics&quot; -  with such a perverse use of &quot;mathematics&quot;, it's no wonder that the protagonist keeps having difficulties in his math studies.<br />Recommending the book for a &quot;young adult&quot; audience is a bad idea. Like Ayn Rand's _Atlas Shrugged_, another work of fascist science fiction, it's bound to poison impressionable minds with a pseudo-philosophy that it's going to take them years to grow out of. It might be interesting, however, to present this book in combination with two other books: Joe Haldemann's _The Forever War_, which presents a much more plausible scenario of the effects of intergalactic war on soldiers and society, and Hans Peter Richter's  _I Was There_, an autobiographical account of what it's *actually* like to grow up in a fascist society (Nazi Germany; readers of _I Was There_ will find a chilling similarity to the society of _Startship Troopers_).<br />Leaving aside the disturbing ideology (which is rather hard to do), the book is reasonably well written (which is why I gave it 2 stars), except for the dialogue, which is suprisingly wooden for such an acclaimed author.",2.0,Books,0,7

It's so very old. So very boring. And it is a shame because the author is able to create an interesting world with interesting characters. It's just the storyline...it's so slow!

"4.5 Stars - Great Set of Balls - but questionable storage.: Great Set of Balls! Ordered the regulation size set with the Blue & Red balls - really didn't want Green ones. The price was reasonable compared to other sets and had good reviews. Really happy with the quality of the balls.<br /><br />Now for the carry case - which is rectangular for the set I ordered - with a single layer (2 by 4) of balls (not stacked in square case). Another desired feature for us for ease of storage in our RV compartment. I should have paid closer attention to the picture of the product and read a couple more reviews. The product picture with the case open is accurate - you just don't realize anything is missing/needed. As indicated by others - the case is not rigid, therefore the balls don't stay in place & cluster together when lifted/moved. If you keep the cardboard box the balls came packed in (inside the case), that will work short-term. Eventually the cardboard will fail...unless you treat it like an heirloom instead of an outside game. We will be fabricating our own slotted box to go in the case for permanent use...similar to old-school milk-bottle crates.  If I had realized the case issue before purchase, I may have kept looking for something that didn't need us to ""fix it"".<br /><br />That being said - we are happy overall with the product. Fortunately my husband is handy and can easily fabricate something that will work better for us long term - using scrap material we already have (no extra $). You may not be as handy or want to deal with it. Perhaps in the future the maker of this product will include a practical, long-term use insert that holds everything in place.",5.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Assembly Suggestion: Do yourself a favor and only assemble parts finger tight at first. Then when the whole unit is together, tighten everything down with wrenches. This will avoid the ""things don't fit"" complaints in other reviews. There is play in all the connections, so if you tighten as you go everything will get more and more out of alignment. Also, i swapped out the wheels with some sturdier and softer tread ones to protect my hardwood floors. If you do the same, get ones with M10 threaded stems. Once I loaded mine with 90 lb dumbbells, the stand was immovable with the wheels included. Lastly, whatever wheels or feet you use, it helps to adjust their height so that the dumbbells are parallel to the ground when racked. If not, the plates for dumbbells using the Bowflex mechanism will not be seated properly once you remove a selected weight making it difficult to re-rack it after your set.<br /><br />Update:  I was unable to actually get the wheels adjusted to the point that the dumbbells were level so if the weight I was using did not include the smallest plate, once I un-rack the weight that small plate would lean slightly toward me making it impossible to re-rack the weights. The solution I found was to glue 2 small metal washers to the outer lip of the rack which forces the small plate to stay in alignment regardless of the downward tilt of that end of rack. You can see the silver washers in place in my photo. This works perfectly. I used rubber cement so if I decide to remove this hack it's not permanent.",4.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Excellent chronicle of the woman and the culture.: This book was such an interesting read that I had a hard time putting it down. Ms. Echols delves into Port Arthur in a way that is very similar to that of Mary Karr. She also looks at aspects of Janis that have not been well-contructed before this. The milieu of San Francisco and the 1960's music scene there is shown in an open and matter-of-fact way. The beginnings of the bands were more haphazard than I ever realized.One cannot understand a person unless they understand the politics and atmosphere, as with this remarkable musician.<br />  On the personal side,  Janis was a woman who wanted what we all want- to love and be loved. Echols defines where many of us let one another down by not being honest with others when they are in too deep.<br />  As Janis wrote &quot;It's so sad to be alone.&quot;<br /><br />  I highly recommend this biography to fans and people who are interested in the culture of the times.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Fair value - average performance: Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service.

"Two reasons not to buy this!: First off, even if you do think these are good Misfits songs, you are better off investing in both the Misfits 'Collection' CDs.  Buy those 2 CDs and you will have all of the 'Earth AD' EP (and a WHOLE lot more).<br /><br />Secondly, IMHO, this is the worst of the Danzig-era Misfits.  Sure, the songs are fast and furious, but it's pretty much just straight forward hardcore.  On this release, the band chose speed over substance.  Gone are the memorable lyrics and catchy melodies; Danzig opts to unintelligibly scream rather than sing on this release.  In many ways it just doesn't feel like the Misfits to me; what I love most about them seems absent here.  With the exception of 'Green Hell', 'Die, Die My Darling' and 'Mommy, Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight', I find myself quite bored listening to this.<br /><br />In any event, this CD should be for 'completeists' only.",2.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,0,8

"I love his books: An incredible book by Sir Anthony Beevor. I love his books. I have never believed that Patton's 3rd Army &#34;saved the day&#34;, and the FACTS in this book prove this. It was a huge TEAM  effort by mostly American soldiers and pilots, who held out against all expectations. The 82 and 101st Airborne are in this book of course, but Beevor also salutes the unsung heroes of the battle, the engineers, many other companies and Divisions.<br />The miscommunication by Hitler's Generals, plus Hitler's idiotic micromanaging, as usual, really hurt them. The Germans fought hard, and are excellent soldiers, although of course I do not agree with their cause. Many of the German soldiers did not either!<br />As usual, France is basically worthless, (except for The Underground and General Leclerc late in the war), and someone should have yanked British General Montgomery out of the fray before the disastrous &#34;Market Garden&#34;, as the Battle of the Bulge may not have happened if that debacle had not taken place. What a silly arrogant man. And also, a pedophile (very hush hush). Bradley is fine but prone to pouting, Patton is overrated and a showboat like Monty, and Eisenhower was the PERFECT choice to oversee these men. My head would have exploded, but Eisenhower keeps his cool ( in public).<br /> I did not know much about evil German General Joachim Pieper, but at least I know he eventually got what he deserved. As I CAN read German, but not French, the names of the little Belgian towns I had not heard of slowed me down a bit; but this book is a MUST READ if you want the COMPLETE STORY. My Great Uncle Charles fought in the battle of the Bulge, and he had been born in Germany! But my Father's family loved America. This amazing book will not disappoint!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Impressive: I have read much of the literature on slavery: non-fiction books about the peculiar institution or its many components, memoirs (and not only the Solomon Northrup deservedly getting so much attention), and--- what is much tougher to write--- those few books that try to get inside the individuals caught in the system, and, yes, it is (figuratively) not only the slaves who are caught. This is about as good an attempt as I have seen, quite beautifully written, multi-dimensional, and appropriately unsentimental.<br />For all the reading I have done, I have to say that, other than its existence, very little seems to have been written about breeding, which &#34;Wash&#34; deals with (and which alludes to details of horse-breeding by way of comparison and which of course reinforces the horror as it applies to humans, and, in particular, to the character Wash). I am a bit puzzled, and would love to know where to turn for the historical basis. It had been my understanding that male slaves were more &#34;valuable&#34; (it is so hard to use non-human terms in reference to human beings) because of their hard labor, females not only because of the work they did (including demanding physical work in the fields but a variety of other tasks as well) but also because they could bear children, i.e. more labor. Large plantations by nature would necessarily have had more men than women. Would it only be the small holdings (the bulk of the properties but not the bulk of the slaves), therefore, that needed to import men (such as Wash) to impregnate the females?<br />I know this is quite beside the point of this extraordinary novel (it's not a history book) but I am curious and want to read more.

"A Life Authentic: A thoughtful, subtle, unique portrait of a sublime idea:  how to reinvent yourself.  If you have not done this in your own life, then this movie may not be for you.  Completely dialogue driven, and full of small hints that lead somewhere unexpected, this movie is not predictable in any way.  Just like life.  Right when you think you have it all figured out, that's when everything changes.  Or so we hope.  Otherwise, it's boring.  Cheers to the adventurous, and the adventure itself.  Sometimes you just need to have the guts to embrace change.  This character has made a life of it.",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Successfully Used with My 4-Year Old Female Tiger Cat to Fly 6 Hours: I have 3 rescue kitties all of which sleep deeply throughout the night every night.  I decided to spend two months in Santa Fe this summer and to take my tiny tiger kitty with me.  My husband wanted to keep the Snowshoe Siamese and Himalayan with him at home.  The tiger kitty is very equanimous; calm is her super power; however, this was her first airline flight and, of course, she had to be in an airline-approved kitty carrier for 6 hours when she is used to total freedom.  Airports and airplanes tend to be noisy and she is used to a calm, serene environment so I decided to research herbal products that might help her during this experience.  I settled on Restful Pet because it has only 3 heathy ingredients -- and I'm very, very glad I did.<br /><br />I stopped giving her food and water at 8PM the evening before our zero-dark-thirty flight.  I gave her 20 drops on an empty stomach 30 minutes before we needed to check in at the airport.  I also put down the flaps on her Sherpa rolling kitty carrier to reduce the noise as much as possible.  She was a dream to travel with.  Admittedly we were in first class on American Airlines.  I arranged for a single seat with no additional seat beside us, which minimized wear and tear on her (and me).  I tucked her under the seat in front of me for a relatively short flight from Medford, Oregon to Phoenix, Arizona.  I kept her inside her carrier at all times per airline regulations.  She slept the whole way except in the Phoenix airport where I placed her carrier on a seat beside me at the gate murmuring baby talk to her softly, explaining the next steps until we arrived at our destination, and petting her inside her carrier.  On the short flight from Phoenix to Santa Fe she went back to sleep.  It appeared to me that she did not experience any distress from her new travel experience.<br /><br />She did have some relatively unusual preparation for flying in that, since I adopted her, I have taken her with me to run errands during the temperate months of the year.  She is, without exception, thrilled to ride in the car and be able to peer out the windows.  In this regard, she behaves more like a dog than a cat.  So, for her, a plane trip was not so large a leap as it might be for a kitty who had never been socialized like this.<br /><br />I was so happy with this product.  I think it provided just the perfect cushion of herbal calmness to ease her through this new experience.  Highly recommend.",5.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26

"Plot Driven vs. Character Driven: This was a quick read. I really liked the openness of Conrad in explaining Amish beliefs to Tamara. She had questions I might have asked, and it was good to get inside his head. He was the best developed character, and I would have enjoyed even more from him, and getting to know the female lead on the same level. (SPOILER ALERT) I would have liked to have had a longer book so that the relationship between the two could have developed more slowly, which would have made the story more believable to me. In the brevity of the book, the main attraction seemed to be  for him, that she was a damsel in distress, and for her, that he was the opposite of the boyfriend she recently left behind. They needed time to find common beliefs, or develop the artistic connection between them to make it more convincing. The mob influence was a little far fetched from my personal experience, but it did serve the purpose of effectively contrasting the worst of modern society, and casting the simplicity of the Anabaptists in an appealing light.",3.0,Kindle_Store,0,20

"Fast seller response and it came with more than the product description says it should?: I'm upgrading from a ThinkCenter M72E I picked up in 2013.<br /><br />I gave them 4 stars for this because the product described didn't match up with the pile of stuff I received. I did get what I ordered but it also came with some things I didn't want.<br /><br />I ordered this particular machine because I thought I would only receive a computer. As it turns out I received the computer described here but with a VGA port too and a bunch of other stuff.<br /><br />This product came with a VGA port (not in the picture or description), a CDROM enclosure that wraps around the entire computer (was easily removable), a mouse (really cheap), and a keyboard (also really cheap).<br /><br />None of this stuff was in the description or the pictures. I sent them a message to see if they actually sent me the correct order or not. When I hear back from them to confirm they sent the right order to me I'll likely change this to 5 stars for this product and leave 5 stars for the seller too.<br /><br />Overall the seller was fast to respond to a previous question (this last one I sent on a Saturday so I don't expect to hear back until a weekday). They double boxed the product to keep it ""extra safe"" and everything was all original Lenovo parts.<br /><br />With everything going 6 cores or better these days I was reluctant to pick up a 4 core processor. This APU is excellent though so I'm expecting this to work for another 7 years.<br /><br />The machine itself is awesome!<br />- The form factor of the case is perfect.<br />- It's quiet.<br />- Responsiveness of everything extremely fast.<br />- It's modern and so far I'm sure it will handle anything I throw at it.<br />- Compiling software and some light gaming have already been remarkably good experiences on this hardware.<br />- Had no problems installing Kubuntu on it (though wireless wasn't setup by default - I'm using a hard line for this machine so I've not even looked into it).<br /><br />It's a great machine at an EXTREME discount over building the same configuration on Lenovo's website.<br /><br />Absolutely worth it!<br /><br />Edit:<br />5 stars. The vendor is excellent and super responsive. The product is exactly what I was looking for at a price WAY below what I could have gotten it for directly from Lenovo.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Bumped this back down to 4 starts. The installed memory is capable of running at 3200 MHZ but the mother board‚Äôs memory bus speed is set to 2666 MHZ. Been running into some minor performance issues that would benefit from the higher bus speeds that this processor is capable of handling (max bus for this processor is 2933 MHZ).<br /><br />Unfortunately the memory bus speed is capped at 2633 MHZ in the bios (with no ability to change it).<br /><br />Still a great computer but this was a little disappointing.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

The fabric of the shoe is woven so I can feel the stretch the more I wear them. The front of the shoe is stiff but I think it's so that the shoe will maintain its look, so it doesn't become too saggy with wear. I think it's a plus, but it is a little rough on the toes! Theses shoes, as with most need some breaking in! The picture does not do them justice at all and I'm glad I listened to the reviews and just ordered them. They would be way more expensive at a shoe store. They really look like boutique quality shoes, I was giddy when they arrived! Speaking of arriving, I ordered them Friday evening, got them the following Sunday!<br />Not only am I ecstatic over these shoes but they provide a level of customer service to match. I got a different style for my 10 year old daughter. I'm not ready to share shoes with her just yet! She is going from the kid shoe sizes to the adults. So we are not sure what exactly her size would be (I should have done more homework on that) so I got her the 36. She could not even get her feet into them. Crestfallen, I emailed the company, ready to ship it back at my own expense, whatever to get her the right shoes. I got an immediate response<br />from them. I responded, telling them what size is would like and expecting them to give me the shipping cost and the exchange process. In response to that, I got an email stating that they would just send me the correct size! Right?! This was a total error on my part ! My daughter's order was shipped just as quickly as mine, they did absolutely nothing wrong. I am still amazed! I know my daughter will be the only one at her school with these shoes so I was was more than willing to ship it back to them for a replacement. I love a company that takes care of their customers! I would absolutely recommend these and any other shoes they make. I know I'm buying myself more! They are affordable but they don't look cheap, stellar customer service. So,yeah get them!",5.0,Amazon_Fashion,1,1

"Okay product for the cost - but not a long term investment: Good product for the cost.  We've had the Pyle vacuum now for about a year.  It  operates solely on hard surface with no transitions and does an excellent job of picking up cat hair, cat litter and tracked in debris including grass, leaves and dirt.  It has been very reliable with only one &#34;problem&#34; incident where, due to debris buildup, it started operating in circles.  Fortunately, we also have an ILIFE A4 and therefore, knew how to remove the cover to clean inside the vacuum.  For it's price, it's been a great vacuum.<br /><br />When compared to our ILIFE A4, we have noted the following:<br />Battery life - much shorter.  Pyle will vacuum between 500 and 800 square feet on one operation while the ILIFE will generally manage 1,500.<br />Noise - much louder.  We seldom hear the the ILIFE which runs upstairs, but we can clearly hear the Pyle from upstairs while it is operating on the lower level.<br />Transitions/entrapment - Pyle hates transitions between hardwood and carpet and will expend most of its battery life trying to get over the transition.<br /> If you are fast enough, you can rescue the vacuum before it uses its battery life, but if not, its finished for a few hours.<br />Reliability - Pyle has had fewer cleaning needs and less downtime than the ILIFE.  In the past year, we've only had one situation where the Pyle was &#34;down&#34; while the ILIFE was down within weeks of purchase and needs a serious cleaning every couple of months.  This may be do to to Pyle's  simpler construction or to the fact that we use it less.<br />Customer Service - we've not had a chance to try it.  The ILIFE had issues first, and we used the same techniques to &#34;fix&#34; Pyle in the one incident where it did not operate.<br />Features:  Pyle has less features than the ILIFE - no remote, no stair sensing, no docking station - but we expected that for the price, and those features are not essential for a reliable operation.<br /><br />When compared to the 2005-2008 Roomba we have previously owned, Pyle is just a thorough and much more reliable.  Roomba never lasted a full year.<br /><br />Update:  After 14 months of use, the Pyle vacuum is no longer functional.  It is turns and spins but will not advance.  This time a thorough cleaning did not fix the problem.  We have not tried contacting customer service as the product is no longer covered by warranty.",3.0,Home_and_Kitchen,0,18

"Great Endoscope for DIY'ers: I work on cars (and other things) a lot, and have always wanted to get one of these to be able to see things in tight spaces (where I would otherwise have to just go by feel, which isn't always very reliable).  The quality of the screen is really great, and the configurability of this is pretty awesome.  The built in LED lights are extremely helpful, as usually the spaces you are trying to look at are (by definition) usually pretty dark and obscured.  I like the design of this unit more than the traditional &#34;pistol grip&#34; type, and this allows this unit to have more accessibility of buttons and ports.  The length of the endoscope extension seemed sufficient for my needs.

"My favorite out of 3 astronaut projectors: Body is light but the head makes it a bit heavier so it doesn't go flipping over. The magnet is strong enough to pick the guy up by his head. The head can go in about a 270 left and right (the decorative cord from the backpack to the helmet makes it not go 360). The head can also tilt back to be practically facing straight up, but won't go back any further (there is no magnet for the back of the head).<br />There is a very faint hum that you really only hear if you're paying attention to it.<br />Nebula colors go red, blue, green, red/blue, blue/green, green/red, a gentle fade through these color schemes, and lastly all three colors at once. The nebula is a very pretty cloud looking. The stars have different settings from always on, always off, and a fade setting where they slowly fade in and out.<br />The cord also works with the big standing version, except the angle of the plug is different between the cords, and this cord also has specs written on it. The plug seems very specific and not easy to buy a replacement just anywhere. This version comes with the USB to wall outlet plug, the big version does not.<br />The remote can turn settings on/off and change brightnesses and speeds, can even slow the ocean waves to a stop.

"True Innovation: I watch LOTS of Korean television. I have seen this actual model on recent shows. I didn't know it was available in America. I'm glad that this new tech made it here. This air purifier is a step up from anything else on the market. The top of the unit flips up and rotates to circulate the air around it. This makes it more efficient and effective at air purification than the competition. The unit fits nicely in most rooms without being obtrusive. It's whisper quiet, so you can use it in a nursery with no problems. You can even operate it by voice command or via the app. If you're in the market for a high quality air purifier, I HIGHLY recommend this one.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

"Reasonably satisfying conclusion to the series (3.5 stars): It's always difficult for an author to wrap up a series in a completely satisfying way.  My Dead Body is the fifth and final novel in the Joe Pitt Case Books, a brutally violent series of novels about Manhattan vampyres.  As with all final novels, it is a challenge for the author to wrap up the loose ends and provide closure on all the major characters (most of them in this series will die of course) and still tell a focused and engaging story.  I'm not normally a fan of fantasy, science fiction, or vampire novels, but I really enjoyed this series.  Of the five novels, I would rank this one as the fourth best.<br /><br />My Dead Body does a good job of tying up those loose ends and manages to bring the familiar faces all back for their final curtain call without it feeling too clunky and contrived.  The story this time involves Pitt being asked to infiltrate the ""Cure House"" to free a young woman who may be pregnant with the Vampyre Messiah.  Joe re-enters the vampyre world he has been hiding from in the NY underground sewer system since igniting a Vampyre war at the end of the last novel.  Soon we are re-immersed in Vampyre politics and civil war as the Vampyre power brokers try to use Joe as a pawn to further their agendas, while he in turn, tries to use them.  And of course there is a healthy dose of the kind of gruesome and brutal violence we've come to expect from the series.  But this final adventure sees Joe spending a lot of his time contemplating his mistakes, wallowing in self pity and considering his inevitable demise.  The pacing of the novel is a little uneven with a little too much emphasis on self-reflection and medical sci-fi regarding the origins and nature of the virus than I thought was necessary.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series, you'll obviously want to see how everything turns out yourself.  The novel still has the elements you expect in a Joe Pitt novel.  It's a reasonably satisfying conclusion to the series, but not the high point that fans of a series always hope for in the much anticipated finale.  If you haven't read any of the Joe Pitt novels and you're thinking of starting the series, this isn't the place to start.  You need to go back to the beginning and read Already Dead.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Small for Adult Bats: What I thought would be hardwood of some sort appears to be bamboo pieces glued together. I have no problem with bamboo since it's hard enough to use for flooring and is considered highly renewable, but technically it is not wood, even though the product description says ""Wood, Bamboo."" That may be splitting hairs perhaps.<br /><br />Overall, the rack pieces seem to be well constructed, they fit together nicely, and the rubberized inserts in the holders are a nice touch. However, the holders for the large end of the bat are on the small side. I got this for my 16 year old grandson to display a couple of his collectible major league bats, but to use them as intended, the larger holder would have to be placed much further down the bat toward the handle than we would have liked. They may work perfectly for Little League sized bats, I can't say. Instead, I used these as fishing rod and reel holders in my garage. They worked well for that application.",4.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Outstanding longer top for yoga: If you're tired of your yoga top creeping up during yoga, the length of the Prana Kaley Tunic adds coverage with this longer length. It also gives a nice silhouette in high quality, quick to dry fabric. It's a very flattering top --really great for full figured yoginis --or as I like to put it, yoginis with curves. Those who want a bit more support can just add a sports bra, though I have to admit that for the price prAna is charging, they really should get more into engineering a Kaley Tunic with more support. I have 4 of these, and prefer these over the usual shorter length yoga tops.  I hope the Kaley Tunic becomes a staple at prAna that they make forever.",5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10
"Great little mini pc!: This does not have an OS installed which is why it sells so cheap and allowing you, the user, to choose between Ubuntu, Linux, or Windows 10.

"Matched my Old Town Canoe!: I recently bought a green Old Town Camper 15 canoe that was a demo at a shop in NH.  It looked great.  When we got it home, we dragged it down to the water and turned it over only to discover that we had scraped a patch of the vinyl skin off down to the core, or that we just hadn't looked at the bottom in the shop and someone else had done that.  In any event, finding the right color vinyl paint to fix it was not easy---the one place online that purported to have a match for the Old Town canoe actually was out of that color.  So i took a chance on this, and yesterday sprayed two coats onto the bottom of the canoe.  You cannot tell I did so, the match is so good. So if your canoe needs sprucing up (or hunter greening up) this is the way to go.  The paint went on easily and has an effective spray head.  Dried quickly.

"No need to pay $400: I saw a YouTuber mention this product at-home gel nails, but she also mentioned her nail tech also uses this product to cure acrylic nails. For $40, it seemed promising for me to buy. It works! I used it both on gel, polygel and acrylic nails. So, it's more than just worth it! The only thing I would nick-pick is when you cure the top coat, I recommend curing for two rounds of 60 seconds. It gives that lasting shine.",5.0,Beauty_and_Personal_Care,1,6
"I have had one for years: When I went to buy a second one of these diffusers, I noticed that the rating was at 3 stars.  I thought that was strange because I know that this one takes a licking and keeps on diffusing.  I bought my son this diffuser a few years ago in order to use essential oils to help his lung condition.  He loves it, has abused it, and it still works.  I waited a couple of weeks to rate this new diffuser thinking that maybe it would not work well.  It is working great.  One thing to note is that it cannot be filled above the fill line, or it will not work as well.  Another thing is that when it beeps and turns off, it is because the water level is too low.  You have to fill it with more water in order to get it to turn on again.  Also, it has several settings that when set, will turn it off and on at intervals.  It really is a great little machine.  It works, and I am completely satisfied with my purchase.",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

Marital ships that pass in the night at least leave notes for each other unless their hostility is verging on divorce, which, clearly, theirs isn‚Äôt. The twists and turns wouldn‚Äôt make for a plausible action film which would take less time to watch than slogging through this book did.

I needed something for lap swimming at the gym. This was it! I am typically a size 6 or 8, and the size 8 fit. I am glad I did not go with the smaller option. The suit seems well-made and I think it will last awhile. It covers a lot, but does not look frumpy; I would describe it as looking athletic. It doesn't highlight my body shape, but it is slimming, and since I didn't want it as a fashion item I found it the perfect mixture of modest, cute, and functional.

"Ashley Book of Knots: This is the best book I have ever read, of any category, fiction, non-fiction, bar none.  Yes, it is a book of knots, but it is far more than just that.  The author was an artist as well as a sailor and this book was the work of a lifetime of fascination with knots.  From an early age he took an interest in any knot he saw.  Knots were documented as to where he saw them, exactly how they were tied, who tied them and why, what their names and uses were, the knots' strengths and weaknesses, and any other pertinent information he could acquire.  Over a period of many, many years he kept these notes and finally wrote the book which is profusely illustrated by his own drawings of the knots and their applications.  As his knowledge became known he was sought out as a consultant by industrial firms and as a part of this work he also conducted testing of certain knots.  The book goes far beyond the knot names and their uses.  It explains why sailors tie decorative knots, why some knots are strong, why some knots are easy to untie, why knots tied by certain tradesmen have to have special characteristics.<br /><br />Mr. Ashley had a keen sense of history and the book is filled with not only the history of individual knots, but the history of trades and how they utilized knots.  You can open the book to nearly any page and read a fascinating story about a knot, a vocation, a way of life, how and why people use knots, the different materials used with knots, or an episode in his own life.  The book can be read as a novel.<br /><br />But if you are looking for practical information on a certain knot, or on a class of knots designed for a certain job, don't think that this information will be hard to find.  Each of the knots is numbered and is rated with a small drawing which is a symbol of the special characteristics of that knot.  Is the knot dangerous? is it weak or strong? Is it easy to tie?  Does it have many uses?  The same knots that are in different chapters are cross referenced and other knots that can serve the same purposes but used in other trades are noted.  Thus the book can also be used as an encyclopedia.<br /><br />I have a library of perhaps 1,000 books.  If, for some reason, I could keep only one, it would be this one.",5.0,Books,1,7
"It looked flimsy when I got it. 3 months later it lived up to its design flaws, leaking boiling water everywhere.: I'm not fond of the design of this one. The filter swings out to the side, daring the pot to topple over to the side when you open it. The plastic looks flimsy, and I'm weary of its durability over time. I've used the espresso side a couple times. It's decent. I have little experience frothing milk, so I managed to get a only a small amount of froth and a huge mess. I had to move this coffeemaker to the left side end of the counter to make getting to the milk steamer more of a possibility. I made less of a mess that way. Maybe I just need some more practice. I do love the coffee timer. I wake up to the fresh aroma without an alarm clock. :)<br /><br />Let me give you an update. I've had this thing for 3 months, now. As suspected, it's cheap design has broken down already. It now leaks water down the side of the coffeemaker so that I hear the sizzling water at the base of the pot. The leaking has only worsened, so I can plan on a 12 cup pot of coffee and lose 4 cups of hot water down the side of the coffeemaker onto the counter. Unfortunately, the counter that I had this coffeemaker on was wood, and the boiling water has damaged the surface of my counter. Not only do I need to order a new coffeemaker, but I need to refinish my counter. In addition to all of this, I regret my waste of $114 on a piece of crap that I would wish on no one. Now I see that the price has gone up to $300??!!! Please don't waste your money.

"An Intimate, Almost Painful Glimpse Into Diane Keaton's Life: ""Let's Just Say It Wasn't Pretty"" will be released tomorrow, and it will be interesting to see how well it's received by fans of Keaton and readers in general. I came of age watching her onscreen. Loved her in a few of her roles. Admired her quirkiness, which seemed to make her more approachable/relate-able than other celebrities. When my pre-publication copy of her newest autobiography arrived, I truly wanted to love it. It's not surprising, though, that a few reviewers have already given it a 1 star rating.<br /><br />Reading the introduction, this book almost seems to have been sparked by an online article titled 'Top 10 Female Celebrities Who Are Ugly No Matter What Hollywood Says', in which Keaton was number five. The writer refers to Keaton as being as old as dirt and ugly when she was younger. Which is unarguably a cruel, demeaning public opinion. Keaton seems to have taken it too much to heart; the 189 pages of ""Let's Just Say It Wasn't Pretty"" read like a cross between personal diaries and tabloid fodder. Most of the chapters meander. It's an *editor's* job to make a final draft flow with cohesiveness, so I won't fault Keaton there.<br /><br />What I will say is she sometimes puts the capital M in TMI, and appears to be a walking, breathing contradiction in terms. For a mature, accomplished woman who admires (even embraces) individuality and advises women to be themselves proudly, she has a lot of dissatisfaction with just about every aspect of herself. There's humorous, mild, self-depreciation, and then there's ripping yourself to shreds unnecessarily... even painfully for the audience. Why? What's to be gained from it? And while her personal fashion style covers everything up, she lays her life and soul bare in this book. Or at least seems to. Including lingerie shopping with her teen aged daughter, sharing her daughter's sizes, style and color choices for the world to know. As a teenager, I would have wanted the earth to open up and swallow me whole, or at least move to a remote island without access to books, television, internet, etc. if my mom shared that kind of information publicly. As a mostly mature woman myself now, I don't need to know what Woody Allen looks like when he gets out of the shower or how many towels he steps on to dry off. Just... TMI.<br /><br />Keaton writes: 'No one wants to be a dilapidated, broken-down, beat-up, out-of-date, cast-off, worn-out, stale example of a human being. We worked hard to become who we are... For those of us who've been separated from reality by fame, being old is a great leveling experience.' That seems to sum up her book pretty well. And I feel extremely grateful I'm not a celebrity, because I look at the aging process very, very differently. It should be celebrated. My mom is a vibrant, very social, active 81 year old today who had stage 4 breast cancer almost 2 years ago. She not only survived a mastectomy and cancer treatment, it didn't level her. Every day is celebrated. As it should be. Sad that Keaton doesn't see it that way.",3.0,Books,0,7

"Works great but a few notes to be aware of: I recently bought this item for patching 9 ethernet lines I ran in my home. I have no complaints about the product thus far, but a few notes. One reviewer noted that the item received was not the same as pictured in terms of how the wires are connected on the back, and that is consistent with my product. In my case this did not bother me, but if it matters to you be aware. Specifically the picture of the item shows all 8 wire mounts per cable being in a row next to each other. On the product I received, like the other reviewer noted, each cable has 4 wires attach on one side and 4 across on the other side. Though I'm a novice at this I can't see how it would have made a difference in organizing the cables for me. Also, make sure to note that if you plan to use the wall mount bracket and you run cables into the middle of the device to access the wire ports near the middle, *you must have the plastic bracket attached before you attach those wires, or run them through it, otherwise you can't attach it! Cables going in from the top or bottom or not a problem, but in the middle the plastic bracket forms a loop. In my case I was able to cut one side of the bracket apart to allow the cables I'd already wired to pass through the bracket. The bracket still attached securely to the wall, the wires seem to punch down very securely and the jacks on the front seem to be well made and function properly.",4.0,Electronics,1,12

"Another Great Play-By-Play novel: Hotness Rating 3 out of 5<br /><br />Another great Jaci Burton sports romance. The Play by Play series continues to draw me in and keep me coming back for more. Quarterback Draw is the 9th book and such a credit to this series that I love. Even better this book gave us a huge introduction to the Cassidy family and I have to say I am in love with these maniacs.<br /><br />Grant and Katrina were bittersweet. Grant was fantastic. He stepped up from the beginning and made his intentions known. He was all in from day one and did all of the right things. Katrina, on the other hand, made my head want to explode. Don't get me wrong I liked her as a character and even respected her a ton considering all she had been through and all that she did to keep her family together. I just really hate when anyone makes another pay for the sins of others. And I know this is human nature, so chalk this up to a compliment that this book made it all seem so real. It frustrated me that no matter how good Grant was that she still held back. If I could find her father I would punch him. Okay maybe not punch, but I would surely give him dirty looks. :)<br /><br />The sub-characters made this book for me. Katrina's brother and sister were hilarious. I loved how they gave her a hard time without being mean. And then there was Grant's family the Cassidys. I have no idea where to even start with them. They were fantastic! The brother's and all of their competitiveness was crazy, exasperating and fun to read all at the same time. I seriously found myself feeling so sorry for their mother. See? This book really brings the feeling of this is really happening.<br /><br />I loved this book and can not wait to read the next one. Hint hint: it's about another Cassidy brother.<br /><br />You can find this review and others at Books, Chocolate and Lipgloss",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"It's Been Put Together: I'll cut right to the chase:  I think that this recording is better in every respect--in EVERY respect--than the original-cast recording!  Start with the sonics and soundstage:  superb here, reflecting the recording improvements available at this time.  The orchestra playing and conducting (Chris Fenwick):  Also superb--more nuanced and detailed than the original.  This quality extends to all the lesser roles in the cast.  (Bravi!)  And last, but of course not least, the two leads:  Jake Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford.  If Mandy Patinkin poured his heart into his portrayal, Gyllenhaal pours even more heart into his, and more mind and soul as well, and sings equally splendidly.  Give him a bouquet.  And Ashford--according to my ears, at least--truly embodies Dot, making Bernadette Peters (whom I love, incidentally) sound like ""Bernadette Peters playing the role of"" Dot.  And as much as I like Peters' voice, I think that Ashford's is even better.  I could go on and on, but I am sure you get my drift, as I am not talking sideways here.

"ultra-Firm: If you want ultra-firm pillow, this is for you. I sleep on my side and usually have shoulder pain / tingling when I wake up but I feel a huge difference after sleeping on this pillow for only 1 night. The shape remains the same throughout the night and provides 100% support for your neck all night. There is a lot of room in the casing of the pillow and that allows you to adjust the loft. I like mine to be slightly higher than usual so it takes pressure off my shoulders. So I conglomerate all the buckwheat in 1 end of the casing and tuck the other end underneath. This works really well because the pill keeps the loft all night and does not sink in.",5.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"SPOILER ALERT: Quite a fine read!!: Archangel‚Äôs Legion by Nalini Singh<br />(Book #6: Guild Hunter Series)<br />Source: Purchase<br />Rating: 4/5 stars<br /><br />**SPOILERS!!  STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVEN‚ÄôT READ THE REST OF THE GUILD HUNTER SERIES**<br /><br />I would love, love, love to say that Archangel‚Äôs Legion, the fifth installment of the Guild Hunter series just piled on the awesomeness but I have to be honest.  In many ways, I was totally blown away by this series in other ways, I felt completely let down.<br /><br />What didn‚Äôt blow me away:<br />**The almost complete dedication of this read to Elena and Raphael.  While I continue to love these characters, especially Raphael, and understand that some serious evolution happened in this read, I am ready for the series to move forward and focus on some of the other characters.  It‚Äôs time for Illium (who is evolving!) and Aodhan (who is stunning in so many ways!) to have their own story.  Hell, I even want to know more about Elijah and his consort, Hannah and Caliane.<br /><br />**The multitude of naughty bits.  If you follow my reviews, you know I loves me some naughty bits and generally speaking, the dirtier the better.  BUT, I have to say, I got a bit tired of all the naughty moments in this read.  I fully appreciate, Singh was working toward a goal and making a point (revealed toward the end) with all the naughtiness but it really got the point where I found myself thinking, ‚ÄúOh, good, Elena and Raphael are shagging again.‚Äù<br /><br />What did blow me away:<br />**Illium and Aodahn!!  Illium is evolving and though he is still our beloved Bluebell, he is becoming something more, something stronger.  Illium still has his wonderful sense of playfulness but his warrior side shines through in this installment making him sexier than ever.<br />As for Aodahn, I am head over heels in love with this angel!  Though generally quiet and unobtrusive, this broken painter/warrior begins to come out into the light in this installment.  And holy crap, does he shine ‚Äì literally! (HA!!  Bluebell and Sparkle!!)  Though we still have no idea about Aodahn‚Äôs past and what it was that broke him, we do know that he now has a desire to come out of the shadows.  Hands down, my favorite scene with Aodahn ‚Äì and in the entire book ‚Äì is the quiet moment between Aodahn and Illium toward the end of the read.  This one brought me to tears.<br /><br />**The Legion.  We all know that even among the Cadre, Raphael is special.  He is the son of two archangels, he ascended far sooner than any other angel in history and, he is the only one among the Cadre who can harm the bat-sh*t crazy Lijuan.  Does he really need any more awesomeness?  Yeah buddy!!  And that awesome comes in the form of The Legion.  Risen from the Sleep, the Legion are only active when the right archangel at the right time is in need of their unique assistance.  Raphael and the rest The Seven are in it up to their necks and just when it seems all hope is lost, The Legion come to the rescue.  Though I am not entirely sure what will happen with them in the future, they are here to stay and I am excited to see what they can do.<br /><br />**The increased role of the Guild: It‚Äôs called The Guild Hunter series for crying out loud but this is the first time I really felt like the Guild played a truly vital role in the outcome of events.  Elena drives home the point for Raphael that the Guild has always assisted the Tower and has always been involved in the control and capture of rogue vampires so why can‚Äôt they be involved in saving the city they too love.  During the height of the drama and the action, Guild members as much as the angels fought to protect their home.  Additionally, it was good to see how the humans, the vampires and the angels came to one another‚Äôs aid during the dark moments of the great battle.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  I am still 100% committed to the Guild Hunter series but this installment did let me down a little bit.  For as disappointed as I was in certain aspects of this read, I was equally excited and pleased with others.  I am still 100% in favor of recommending this series to readers but do sincerely hope that the next few installments will see Elena and Raphael once again taking a back seat to some of the other characters in the series.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"A pleasant surprise, full of unpleasant horrors: Okay, bear with me for a few moments here, because this may sound like a criticism, but it's really a grateful nod to the author. Emergence reminds me of late 80s horror flicks like Critters, Ghoulies, or The Gate - works of horror with a coming-of-age element, ostensibly marketed at a young adult audience, but which were certainly more graphic and far more mature than any parent would have ever expected. It's deceptive, particularly in the early chapters, but patience pays off.<br /><br />It doesn't quite achieve the classic coming-of-age horror of a Stephen King or Robert McCammon, but William Vitka tells a great tale and does it well.<br /><br />With elements of zombies, body snatchers, and tentacled monsters √† la Lovecraft, Vitka lays the foundations for a rather deep tale early on. He puts his young charges in harm's way, challenges them, and forces them to confront their fears. Not only that, but in forcing them to grow up so quickly, he bestows upon them some interesting powers or abilities that, without spoiling too much, are intrinsically tied to the creatures besieging their city. The titular Emergence operates on a number of different levels, referring to the emotional and psychological emergence of the teens, the physical emergence of the monsters from beneath the city, and the intellectual emergence of the truth regarding just who (or what) the true players and motives are.<br /><br />Like I mentioned in my opening, this is a deceptive tale in terms of violence and gore. All young adult pretensions aside, this is an absolutely brutal book, with enough blood, guts, and tentacle slime to satisfy the most jaded reader. The juxtaposition of such young heroes against such mature violence is, no doubt, a deliberate one, but it's not played for mere shock value. It's simply maximized for the needs of the story, allowing adolescent fantasies and nightmares to play out naturally against such unnatural horror.<br /><br />I think what I appreciated most about the tale is the way Vitka layered the different elements, revealing one threat after another, before even touching upon the concept of superhuman (or, perhaps, inhuman) abilities. It's not a matter of dumping everything on the reader and watching them run with it. Rather, it's a smart game of cat-and-mouse, engaging the reader, toying with both their emotions and their expectations, and leaving them to wonder if there's yet another layer to come.<br /><br />All-in-all, a well-done, pleasant surprise, full of unpleasant horrors. Emergence  is worth the read.",4.0,Unknown,1,32

Movie pales in comparsion to the book: The movie much like Hugo's orginal book is moving. Laughton's portrayal is poignant and makes the heart ache and made me at least want to reach out a give Quasimodo the understanding he so desperately longs for. Maureen O'Hara's Esmelda was shown to be more full of good graces than in the book. I was slightly unimpressed as the movie failed to fully realize the church as a chracter which is how Hugo intended it. The one thind that film did very well was illustrate Quasimodo's love for his bells which is the only requited love in the whole story. It is not hopeless. For those who prefer Hugo's tragedy the end might prove as a disappointment as Quasimdo is the only one who has tragedy happen to him and is left alive to wallow in it. However it is probably the closest to the orginal story than any other dramazation.,4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Great!: Honestly it was awesome! The entire series (trilogy) was awesome! But I gave four stars because I was disappointed with the ending honestly...it didn‚Äôt have a sense of finality to it. There was too much unanswered. I understand you couldn‚Äôt realistically answer those questions right at the end of this book because everything still works because the princes are still just heirs and they are all still in a secret relationship for the majority...but they won‚Äôt stay young and carefree forever and the parents won‚Äôt be alive for ever and so what happens when the princes inherit their respective thrones? Violet is still a nobody, her status hasn‚Äôt changed hardly accept as a representative who‚Äôs done some good. How could she marry both princes/kings later? Or will she marry one and just have trysts with the other once he marries for convenience or something. Idk and Mattie hasn‚Äôt worked out her relationship with Zach after 4+ years?! Come ON! And the reporters and paparazzi and various newspeople in this fantasy world don‚Äôt catch a whiff of scandal? I find that hard to believe. It‚Äôs just too much for my brain. The ending was very come-what-may and open-ended and I don‚Äôt really like those kind of endings though I kind of understand why it was the ending here. It would be another series probably to answer all the questions I have about the issues they are sure to encounter once their relationship is made public knowledge and responsibilities to their respective kingdoms come into the picture.

"Great Tape, Saved Us from Continued Frustration: My wife and I were tearing our hair out because our dog would always sprint along our runner and slide it along our hardwoods. We'd have to move it back into position multiple times a day! At first, we tried a mesh grippy underlayer that was supposed to hold the rug in place, but really that just required moving two things back in place.<br /><br />This carpet tape worked wonders! We placed two short strips on each corner of the runner and two in the middle of the long edges, and it has held completely in place for months! We're going to repeat the process on all of our other rugs, as well.<br /><br />We have not noticed any damage to our hardwoods when we lift the rug (relatively easy to do, even with the tape), and even tested by pressing down a good-sized strip directly on the wood and pulling it up, with no damage. Test it on your own floors, of course, but it really has worked well for us!",5.0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1,30

I use it 1-2 times per week and my dandruff and build up is GONE. A couple of hints if you get winter scalp like me- I follow this up with a pretty heavy conditioner from ears down to make sure my hair doesn't dry my long hair out. Also my old stylist says to make sure to dry your hair with a blow dryer on cool/warm. This actually blows the flakes off your scalp (trust me, it helps a lot).

(I can't get the iTunes 64 to install - I think because I have MS Office 32 bit and other 32 bit APPS but no one seems to know for sure)<br /><br />The iPAD documentation with the mini2 is so scarce it is impossible to know what you have until you get on line and update software.  This may be different if you are using wifi or a MAC for set up.<br />I am amazed at how well the iPAD works with my windows 8.1 PC!  My Samsung tablet can only communicate via Bluetooth as I disabled my home wifi as kids were targeting houses in the area using their wifi IDs -",4.0,Unknown,1,32

"Velvet Revolver is better than ever!: I eagerly awaited the release of Velvet Revolver's 2nd album, Libertad but I was a bit nervous, too...in between worrying whether Scott Weiland could keep himself sober, could they do better than a very good Contraband album?? Well, they did it!!! My very first impression was, they sound so much crisper, tighter, playing as a unit rather than everyone separately playing their part, which was sometimes the case on Contraband. I have never heard Scott Weiland sound better, his vocal range is amazing!! There is not one bad song on Libertad & some critics are railing against their cover of ELO's Can't get it out of my head, I loved it!! I think they made a mistake making She builds quick machines their 1st single, I would've gone with Mary, Mary which I literally can't get out of my head. The 3 slower songs are very good, loved Gravedancer, loved it!! I even love the country ditty at the end, it somehow perfectly ends the album, it is just absolutely amazing that this band, which obviously enjoys playing together, can produce this much good music. They are now purely Velvet Revolver, no longer former members of GNR & STP. Run out & buy this excellent album ASAP!!!",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Oh holy hell! I am going to try and put into words, ever so graciously, what this book did to me.: Oh holy hell! I am going to try and put into words, ever so graciously, what this book did to me. This story had me giving an eye roll at the beginning to the slimy freak that was hitting on Emily, to fanning myself and laughing at the kiss and arrogance of Jake who is trying to help Emily out with the slimeball, then squirming in my seat yelling ‚ÄúRUN!‚Äù to Emily when she witnesses a brutal murder. THIS ALL HAPPENED AT THE VERY BEGINNING! What a way to start a story! I was stuck at this point. Very invested and couldn‚Äôt put this book down. Turns out Jake works for the FBI and is trying to take this murderer down but now has to save Emily and put her in witness protection for her safety. These two are both hawt and absolutely attracted to each other but no matter what, things go from bad to worse. There is a leak and the safe house has been compromised. Jake goes ‚Äúrogue‚Äù and takes Emily to stay with his family in the boonies in Texas. The angst between these two is INTENSE! Jake has morals and the job comes first but Emily is slowly wearing him down. As with most stories our two main characters carry a ton of baggage. Emily has her reasons and is very stubborn and always a live in the moment type of person. She goes for what she wants and when she wants it. And if it doesn‚Äôt pan out she moves on. This personality really bumps heads with Jake who is very rule oriented and very by the book trying to protect her. As with most relationships when we argue things are said that we don‚Äôt necessarily mean but these two are under so much stress with all the craziness that is going on that things get crazy between the two. She is super stubborn and just wants to go back to the way things were before the murder but Jake is realistic and has to push her back to make her see reason. These two are constantly going back and forth getting under each other skins and trying to get into bed with one another. And all of the supporting characters from Emily‚Äôs friends Dale and Gina to Jake‚Äôs aunt and uncle and all of his childhood friends makes for an super funny and super eventful story. I absolutely recommend Tangled in Texas to everyone and am looking forward to reading the second. Alison Bliss is a new author to me and I am tangled up this story!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Can't wait for more: Rock My Body by Lee Piper is the second in her Mondez novels but can be read as a standalone. It is the story of Riley, a good girl that is looking for true love, and Dominic, a bad boy guitar player that never takes a woman to his bed more than once. When Dominic offers Riley that most intense night of her life she suggests that they keep it platonic. I found his reaction to this laugh out loud funny. As the story passes you get to see behind the masks that both characters wear and get to see that they both have a lot to work through if they are ever going to be together.<br />I loved this story. All of the characters, main and supporting, just jumped off the page. Their journey of Riley and Dominic was both funny and heartbreaking at times. While this was my first story by this author it definitely won‚Äôt be my last. Five stars for a fantastic story about two people that are complete opposites coming together to heal the wounds of the past.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Power seems great but data had issues.: I love the idea of a ""magsafe-"" style charger for the phone or other devices.  This cable seems to be well made and I love the woven sheath rather than the typical plastic/rubber sheath on most cables.  Plugging this into both my power strip (which has a USB-C charging port) and a fast-charge AC adapter, my phone recognized it and stated ""charging rapidly.""  When I plugged it into the computer, however, things went a bit south.  The computer (Windows 10) kept stating that the USB device malfunctioned 4-5 times before it turned off the port.  It also wouldn't charge using the port anymore until I unplugged it and plugged it back in.  I tried this with both cables with the same results.  The few times it did actually work, after about 2 minutes, it disconnected and said the device malfunctioned.  If you need a cable for purely charging purposes, I can recommend this cable, as it seems nicely made and has 4 charging plugs for your devices.  If you're looking for a data cable, I can't recommend this due to the errors I had when using it.",3.0,Electronics,0,12

"Concise and complete with some errors (see note below): I used this book to supplement my M1 course in biostats. It has all the topics and they are presented completely and clearly for the most part, though I'd like to see more specific short examples. My main complaint is that there are some errors as follows:<br />page 71 I think the formula for specificity is wrong<br />page 94 there is an example where the Population Attributable Risk is calculated to be 0.068 and the next sentence refers to 7.2%, which may have been the value in a previous edition. Confusing.<br />These are just the errors I noticed that didn't agree with my course or with the First Aid stats section. Made me nervous that there might be other errata that I didn't notice because I'm not as familiar with the topic. All in all seems like a good source for Step 1, but I can't yet confirm this.<br /><br />Update 1/30/14:<br /><br />I emailed the author about the above mentioned errors and he promptly replied.<br /><br />My email to him:<br />On page 71 of the 4th edition of ""High-Yield Biostatistics..."" Specificity is given in an equation with ""number testing positive who do not have the disease (TN)"" in the numerator of the given equation. Based on what is written on page 70 and what I've seen in other sources, shouldn't the numerator of the specificity equation be ""number testing NEGATIVE who do not have the disease (TN)?"" Is this a misprint in the new edition?<br /><br />His reply included the following:<br />""There is one other error too:  In Chapter 8, page 90 the numerator in the equation for Prevalence rate reads ""number of new cases of the disease"". The word ""new"" should not be there. In the text the definition is correct, but in the equation it is not.""<br /><br />I give the product 4 stars because of the above mentioned errors and 5 because of the quick response from the author.

Our crate is in the living room and we kept banging our feet and legs on the old one, no matter how we tried to keep the door open all the way. It eventually got half closed right in our path. This solves that problem completely and we couldn't be happier with it. The door opens and closes effortlessly. Our dog never makes an attempt to open it, but it looks like it would be hard for any dog to get it open. Highly recommended over a standard crate.<br /><br />One small issue is that I did remove the &#34;lock&#34; that is supposed to keep the door from falling down accidentally.

"3 1/2 stars.  Just okay for me.: OK, I may get slammed for this review but to each his own and this one just wasn‚Äôt one for me.  As much as I LOVED Remy in the first three books, I never did feel a connection with Greyson.<br /><br />Greyson (aka Zero) is one mysterious man.  He is known as Zero because you can‚Äôt find anything about him.  He appears and then he‚Äôs gone.  Melanie, Brooke‚Äôs best friend who married Remy, is one wild woman that I certainly did not expect at all.<br /><br />‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the man of your dreams, Melanie.  I‚Äôm your worst nightmare.‚Äù - Greyson<br /><br />When Greyson literally saves her day, Melanie knows she is drawn to him but also soon finds out that he can disappear just as fast as he appears.  She soon finds out how dangerous he is but also knows she has never felt anything like she does with him in her life.  She realizes that his world may be one that she doesn‚Äôt want and I really was a little disappointed with her.<br /><br />‚ÄúYou may be zero in your world‚Ä¶but you‚Äôre everything to me.‚Äù ‚Äì Melanie<br /><br />I guess what threw me about this book was that I was expecting more emotions from Greyson than what I got.  I know he‚Äôs meant to be bad and secretive but I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòwowed‚Äô or ‚Äòwoo‚Äôed‚Äô by him at all.  I am always one to read a book a day and this one took almost three days.

"Sigh* Finally!: I very seldom find a book that features The main characters in their late 30s and 40s that give you the same metaphorical high of a first love. This book definitely did that.<br />First I should say as a woman who just turned forty it has been a little hard recently to relate to all the books I have been reading of heroines in their early twenties finding love. I personally think one of the hardest pills to swallow is the realization that you are getting older. But you are also evolving.<br />It was so amazing to read Aspen‚Äôs and Maksim‚Äôs story and to relate to their love, insecurities, and personal triumphs. The Author made an antihero and heroine that are relatable to an age group that can be largely ignored, I think, in romance genres. Her quote ‚ÄúThe risk of love isn‚Äôt worth the pain of betrayal ‚Äú, I‚Äôve literally thought that over the years. Their meeting was unconventional (unless you are in Vegas, which they were) but nonetheless sweet. From having those butterflies in your tummy because you missed them so much, to voicing their insecurities about themselves to their partner, to having an argument for the first time and feeling the sting of rejection. This was beautifully written and reminded me that it‚Äôs never to late to fall in love and that it doesn‚Äôt only happen when you are in your twenties. If it didn‚Äôt have the exciting aspect of the mafia world, I would still read it just to see their love story. And I love my mafia books! So read this book! It‚Äôs great!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Be Wary of Sizing: After reading the reviews (which seemed to be all over the place in consideration to sizing; some people said they run small, some people said they run large,) I decided to take the gamble. I just ordered the largest size because I‚Äôm no small chicken (my typical size in men‚Äôs pants would be 36‚Äù-38‚Äù waist, and 30‚Äù inseam.) Also, you can always make adjustments to downsize a piece, but it‚Äôs pretty hard to let something out without extra fabric. The more reviews I read, the more I worried I wouldn‚Äôt fit into the overalls.<br /><br />They arrived quickly and to my surprise, they were a lot bigger than I expected. The legs are pretty wide -very little taper, and I will definitely need to hem the bottom of the pants, but the part I was worried about -the torso fit fine and even had a bit of wiggle room. (Sidenote: they also have two buttons on each side by the waist if you need a little extra room.) The black denim has a sort of sulfur-y odor from the dye, but I‚Äôve dealt with that plenty times before and is not much of an issue to me.<br /><br />Overall (pun intended,) I‚Äôm just happy they fit and are comfy. The material is decently thick denim and the only alteration I‚Äôll have to make is hemming them for my stumpy little legs. For the price of other, lesser quality overalls, this is pretty impressive.",5.0,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,1,10

The company is called Ralink.  Look for the RT256x chip driver on ralink's website. (I would post the link, but amazon appears to remove it if you do)  Once you download and install it, the card will work quite well in Windows 7 (don't forget to uninstall the MSI driver first).<br /><br />So overall the card is pretty decent.

"More experimental..and even better...than Tidal: ""Tidal"" was an amazing debut from teen Fiona Apple, setting a high bar for her to measure up to on the dreaded ""sophomore slump"" album. Between ""Tidal"" and writing these songs, someone really broke Apple's heart...and the tension is palpable throughout the disc.<br /><br />The raw emotion vented here encompasses all out rage (""Limp""), desperation (""Love Ridden"") and denial (""On the Bound""). Not only is the hurt here, but the struggle from Apple to get past it all even if means ""rebound"" relationships: (""A Mistake"" and  and ""Fast as You Can"").<br /><br />Musically, the sound expands as she toys with loops and faster tempos (the aptly named ""Fast as You Can""), cocktail jazz (""I Know""), Beatlesque flourishes (""Paper Bag"") and guitar distortion (""The Way Things Are""). Vocally, Fiona allows herself some occasional belting that works well.<br /><br />I can't single out any tracks as needing work but my favourites are ""Limp"", ""Paper Bag"", ""Fast as You Can"", and ""Love Ridden"".

"initial impression.: I have not yet had the chance to take it out to the range and try it out, so this will probably be updated once I do, but my initial impressions are good. the reticle is clear and feels solidly built. It is rather long, but if it works well I don't much care about that.<br /><br />**** Updated review 4 stars****<br />My initial impressions held true. I have put about 400 rounds through my .308 on which this is mounted and it has held true. It is easy to adjust for the varying distances at which I shoot that rifle and is clear at all ranges that I have tried it at thus far. My two issues with it are the scope mounts that it comes with are not super great and it does not allow for resetting of the turret which is very helpful when shooting long range. The scope mounts are adequate enough for the most part but they did pop loose on me after a couple hundred rounds, which could vary well be a user error. As for the turret it is not absolutely necessary that the turret be able to reset after being zeroed but I do find it helpful because it helps to minimize the amount of extra work I need to do in order to calculate my adjustments at long range. All in all however I would definitely recommend this scope to any shooter on a budget, and I will more than likely buy more scopes from PINTY in the future.",4.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Their QA needs more QA.: The bands are as they appear in the image, the pull-up bar comes flat-packed, requiring assembly. In the photo, see the curved bits that go up to the bar that's in the air (the piece that normally is on the back side of the door frame, relative to your body)? Well, those two arms weren't equally bent. This means that when assembled one side is 2 inches lower than the other. This is not safe to use, not good for the door frame.<br /><br />I contacted Black Mountain about this, but as of writing, they've only had about 2 hours to reply. The metal is strong enough that I can't bend it back by hand, and I don't have a vice+long tube to modify the bend with. On one hand, it was cheap.

"Love this Fountain: This birdbath fountain is a beautiful addition to our garden.  We have been running it for about three weeks, and it so far works perfectly.  Is just the right sound--not too loud--even when sitting close by, was easy to put together, and the feel of it is sturdy without being too heavy for me to carry to the garden. To ensure a level surface, I placed it on a round patio block.  I highly recommend to anyone who would like an attractive, easy to operate, self contained water feature for their garden.",5.0,Unknown,1,32

"Bring it Chicago Winter!: We're dealing with 30 below zero wind chills right now in Chicago, so this couldn't have arrived at a better time! The kids and adults in our family love wearing fleece balaclavas. This one's warm, thick and reasonably soft. The free bonus gloves are a bit cheaply stitched, but welcome too, as we are chronically misplacing and losing gloves and it's stupid and dangerous to go without in the dead of winter. We ordered the L/XL and it fits the teens, tween & adults just fine. We haven't tried this black fleece balaclava under ski helmets yet, but it is thick enough for Chicago winters. We have found the binding around the face seals out wind and snow well and the flat seam construction is comfortable.

"a must for aspiring filmmakers!: The commentaries on this film are an absolute MUST for aspiring filmmakers.  There are two separate commentary tracks, one by Corman and Sayles, one by Gayle Anne Hurd.  They are fascinating lessons in the art,not to mention the joys, of moviemaking.  The ""can-do"" spirit, the creativity, the desire for artistic excellence on a budget, and yes even the fun of making the movies will inspire anybody who ever thought of pointing a camera.  Corman and Sayles offer a lot of things to consider for all the people ramping up their digital cameras, and some useful tips for any era (flashing lights can make a crappy set look much better - as any fan of the original Star Trek knows)<br /><br />The commentary is really a ""warts and all"" kind of thing in some respects.  Hurd's comments include an incident in which a tech guy is accidentally cut and severs his femoral artery and has to be rushed (in Hurd's car!) to the hospital.  On the other hand, Hurd talks about how she and James Cameron were painting a set at 3:00 a.m. and reflecting on how well they worked together and vowed to keep making movies together - a partnership which eventually led to Terminator 2.<br /><br />The lessons to be learned by aspiring filmmakers on these commentaries are definitely worth the price of the DVD.  And it's not a bad little movie either.",3.0,Movies_and_TV,0,22

"avoid this POS at all costs! buy the eu version if you MUST have it!: here ill post the review on the normal game i wrote:<br /><br />Firstly let me say i was REALLY looking forward to this game.<br />Unfortunately if you played the first game from launch you will remember how buggy it was, how slowly things got fixed, and how it felt like Ascaron did not care about you at all. Welcome to sacred 2!<br /><br />While in 2 years i'm sure the game will be playable and fully rock, currently it is a complete disappointment. Most of us cant advance the multiplayer campaign mode without finding some poor sod to do it for us, MOST of the tele-portal things don't work (even though you can see them on your map), and alot of players cant make a multiplayer game PERIOD after level 60.<br /><br />To look at things aside from the ones glaring me in the face every time i try to play this game... There are tons of invisible walls, the pathing is just dumb (as-in my temple guardian seems to be doing something tea-bag related to monsters i am trying to attack MOST of the time..he just kinda wants to get close to them ..even if he's a foot away, he wants to get 6 inches closer...and if the monster moves, he wants to get closer again), you need a pretty high end machine to run it (not really a con, but the performance vs. spec. ratio is way off -MSI 8800 ultra, 8 gigs ram, 3.2 ghz dual core processor, vista premium 64 and i STILL get sudden drops in performance every now and then for no apparent reason..i un-installed the elite GFX and it changed nothing so it isn't really the problem, i think in general its poorly coded), and the networking is garbage. Now i play online a lot, and have for a long time now, i know the difference between dropped frames and lag and differentiate, this is lag in the worst possible way, switching combat arts=a 1.3 sec delay, drinking a potion before you die about 1 solid second (which in game=time is life and death) there are few things worse in gaming than waiting for a server to realize you drank a potion a second ago as your health bar keeps dropping.<br /><br />On still a third level i am one of the schmucks that bought the CE. It is THE cheesiest CE i have seen in 30+ years of gaming. the only thing i can think of that comes close was i once bought a comic book that was collectible simply because it had a hole through the center of the cover.<br />The map is the same map you have in game before you uncover anything, the cd sampler is a joke (not that i care for the band or anything), and worst of all all 4 disks are stacked onto 1 bindle. the elite GFX disk while a nice gesture is from what i hear soon to be available for download anyways and can currently be pirated pretty much without penalty as it is; despite paying customers having to deal with DRM.<br />Now for the positives. has great character development and alot of possibilities for each class (though not as many as sacred underworld since there aren't as many classes). The graphics are real tight and the world is rich with little details, i don't think there is an empty table in the whole game, every single one seems to have various beakers, books, or tons of other little intricacies scattered on and around them. The difficulty online is adjustable, so you can turn it up if you don't feel you are being challenged, and the monsters are sometimes quite impressive.<br /><br />The sounds are just ""ok"" but thats the norm in any game (with the exception of a few starwars games i rarely see sound effects that go off without a hitch), the weather is pretty impressive at times, especially in lightning storms, and the world in general feels very huge and very alive.<br /><br />In 2 years i can safely say this game will be a knock out. For now it sucks horribly, it has been WEEKS without most of us being able to simply play the game as it was intended, and Ascaron does not seem to care at all (nor do anything about it obviously). I feel like they are putting all their effort into pushing out the console version which i guess they don't understand is going to get them nowhere if all the PC players (who ARE in fact their bread and butter) are badmouthing their game and giving it horrible reviews (as if we don't talk to console gamers or something).<br /><br />in short look to pick this game up in 2010 when it will most likely finally be playable.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />that is a link to the games official forums, while they do delete A LOT of posts just a quick glance will show people who have been having problems for MONTHS now getting ZERO response from ascaron..<br />the worst part of it all is they just released the ""ART"" that comes with the CE for free on the site, so the elite GFX is only a matter of time.<br /><br />by the way, the servers are LOCATED in germany!!!!!!!! why they released a separate NA version of the game leads to only 1 conclusion, they wanted more money. now mind you the euro players are on a separate server than the US players, but BOTH those servers ARE in fact at time of this writing located in germany (as indicated by tracert protocols).<br /><br />the 4 song disk by blind guardian = whoop de doo (even more so than ""who are these guys?""), and the carrier imp is only usable in closed net...yes the closed net that is online only and has been pretty much un-playable since launch (see link above). they are not fixing anything or even commenting on the situation. the single player part of this game is worth 20$ at MOST! there is no way anyone should pay for a game to be developed except venture capitalists, yet here we have ascaron acting asif. they never even fixed needing to alt+tab after launching the client to get the mouse to work from the free trial!! yet they use a securom that can only be activated TWICE to protect this trash! pings of over 600 for closednet on my 30 meg line? its a disgrace to gaming and a BIG disgrace to germany (possibly the biggest in history since they released this BY CHOICE).<br /><br />in closing if you completely dis-regard everything i said above i want to note: 1 of the load screens says the cause of ALL this games issues..<br />""developed and tested on DELL"" (apparently germany doesn't know dell is to PC what the Yugo was to the automobile)",1.0,Unknown,0,32

"You have been lied to about the comfort of other products.: This is my second Diva cup. Nothing was wrong with the first one, but I wanted a backup for later down the line, and I grabbed this while it was on a down-tick in pricing.  This is a sound economic investment, because once you get over that learning curve in how to use it and insert properly, you will never need to buy pads or tampons again.  This is perfect for people with eco-friendly wishes, because there's less waste, and it's perfect for anyone who doesn't like the hassle of buying products monthly just because we are female! It says to empty it every 12 hours, but I'm quite forgetful, so I typically empty it once a day in the shower.  Yes - there's an ick factor here.  But it's offset by the fact that I've not ruined any clothing since starting this method of flow control.  My cramps are greatly reduced, and there is no longer any offensive odors associated with this time of the month.  It's pain-free, and extremely, EXTREMELY comfortable to use. This is also perfect for anyone who works with animals in any capacity.  They typically know and can smell the blood - zookeepers, doggie daycare workers, whale trainers, equestrians, and dive instructors should have this as a matter of practicality.  No blood leaks in the pool or ocean or whatever, so you can swim safely without the wick of a tampon sucking lord-knows-what in an upstairs-direction.  No blood smell for the animals to alert to and act 'funny' around.  Buy this product! You will not regret it!",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Sweet love story: The first thing that I want to say is, there isn't any get my straight friend drunk and rape him in this story. I saw what another reviewer wrote and I have to admit if I had seen the review I wouldn't have read the story cause that isn't my thing. However, I can see how this reviewer got confused because they didn't read the story.<br />At the very beginning there is a part that talks about a gay man sitting across from his straight friend who is only in a blanket cause he showed up in the rain. The straight friend is drinking alcohol and confessing his life story but the gay friend isn't paying attention because all he can think about is getting the straight friend to bend over for him.<br />What this is, is a story prompt. Fans send a scenario to an author and the author writes a story around it. There is even a photo prompt. The problem is right after the story prompt, the blurb for the book starts, and directly after that the book starts. There isn't enough spacing between all of that and I had to reread it a couple of times to figure out exactly where the story begins.<br />I don't want to say much about the story because it's short and I don't want to give anything away cause I hate when other reviewers do that.<br />I will say it was well written and there were sweet moments and passionate moments. It was well written and believable. I can say that often times stories are a little unreal and that's ok because sometimes that is why we read them. We need to suspend belief and believe the impossible, like Disney fairytales instead of the brothers Grimm.<br />However, these characters are very realistic and you can see the events in a that could probably happen way.<br />It's a free read as I am reading this, so go ahead and read it<br /> I will be looking for more of this author's work.",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

Finally after struggling to learn how to squat and getting nowhere with local ""certified"" trainers, an Internet search led me to the author and his book Starting Strength. Just wading into first few pages of that book I quickly realized that every other source of information about the subject of strength and how to attain it, that I have read, was complete garbage. Mr. Rippetoe presents such a simple, logical approach to strength in all of his writings that you feel like a fool for falling for all of the sophistry out there. His two books: Starting Strength and Practical Programming have changed my life. I do not say that lightly, before reading Mr. Rippetoe's books I could not squat at all, I had no appreciable strength and nothing really to show from years of ""working out"". Since then, I have squatted 400lbs, deadlifted 455 and standing pressed 175, and I plan on more! The thing is, before reading Mr. Rippetoe's books, I would have never even conceived that I could lift those numbers.<br /><br />Like others have pointed out, this third edition of Practical Programming contains a significant amount of examples of the training methods. It really hammers home the idea that the programs aren't fixed and you can tailor them to your needs and sport.<br /><br />If you want to really know what works, why, and how to do it, I strongly recommend you pick up both this book and Starting Strength third edition. You will not regret it.",5.0,Books,1,7

"Not as nice as my other Tevas: I got these Tevas to replace my worn out ones.  I don't know what the model was of the older ones, but they were the cheapest ones I could find at the time.<br /><br />When comparing the two, the straps are significantly narrower on the Pretty Rugged 2's, and they cut into my big toe.  The velcro is as wide on both of them, but the soft foamy under side, under the velcro, was only as wide as the velcro on the new shoes.  On the old shoes it was much wider and provided better padding from the velcro.  Just wearing them a few minutes around the house left a red dent in my big toe.<br /><br />They have an interestingly springy sole which felt like it might be comfortable if I had kept the shoes, but the arch support felt less supporting.<br /><br />Also, the triangle shaped piece of plastic that holds the straps together at the ankle was much smaller and had less padding than my older Tevas.",2.0,Unknown,0,32

"READ EVERY SINGLE WORD: Eliza is a brilliant writer and is, in my opinion, one of the best authors of lesbian romance. I really enjoyed the book, but I felt that the chemistry between Charlotte and Abigail was a bit underdeveloped, which is definitely different from Eliza's typical portrayal of a couple. The timeline between the two also felt rushed and incomplete. I would have liked a bit more character development, as well as more tension and intimacy between Abigail and Charlotte. Don't let this bum you out, however. It's different from the other books that she has written, but it's gold nonetheless! Chemistry does exist very much so, and the book still includes little cute jealousy scenes that I love so much in all of her books. Bittersweet Homecoming is a must-read (at least maybe two times). Be sure to read her other books; they're nothing short of amazing (especially Don't Call Me a Hero).",4.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Dimming Functionality Not Acceptable: I bought this to replace an existing Lutron dimmer that controls the lights in my media room. I was keen to get the remote capability and the Alexa integration.<br />So far i've been modestly frustrated by the tendency of the device to lose it's connection with my network. The wifi signal is strong with the Netgear Orbi system being 15Ft away in the same room. This is inconvenient but tolerable.<br />The piece that simply doesn't work for me is the dimming capability. With the lutron dimmer there was a seemingly infinite graduation of brightness available to me but most critically, the lutron would allow me to configure the bottom level brightness for the system.<br />The Wemo on the other hand sets it's own minimum brightness threshold and the user can only configure this minimum level to be brighter, not dimmer. In my case this new baseline is much much brighter than what i had available with the lutron and it sets my media room lights at an unacceptably bright level for night time viewing.<br />In checking with wemo they advised that this level of user configurability is not available and so i could add it to the list of feature requests in the forum.<br />I was hoping to use this system in my child's room as well but again, the minimum brightness is too high for the night time lighting i was hoping to achieve.<br />Alexa control is nice but robust and configurable dimming control seems like a must have basic.

"Ooooh, pretty.: I just got into tabletop roleplaying and wanted to get my own set of dice before my first game night instead of borrowing a set from one of my friends. These caught my eye since I'm a sucker for a nice, deep purple.<br /><br />Really delighted with my purchase! The colors are even more gorgeous in person and I love how they change in different lighting. I'm also especially glad I bought these because they're so readable: the gold really pops against the purple and so the numbers are still easy to read even in dim lighting.<br /><br />My only very minor complaint is that the 0-9 d10 has a small but noticeable white blemish on the lip between the 3 and the 8; it still feels smooth, so I think it's more of a scuff than a true ding and I doubt it would have any affect on my rolls. The d4 also has a tiny blemish at the tip where the 1's are, and the surface is slightly rough, but again, it feels and looks more like a small scuff than an actual ding. I suspect those dice simply got a little banged around more than usual during shipping, no big deal.<br /><br />Minor cosmetic issues aside, I'm very happy with my dice and looking forward to using them!",5.0,Toys_and_Games,1,31

"The Series continues to be solid. Great Idea.: This volume consists of a four issue story (continuing the main thread in the comic) and a short one issue story. The main story is called ""Americana"" and it is about the Fables from America. Fables such as Paul Bunyan. The reason Jack wants to go there is to find a treasure and in the way he meets up with Hillary Page. She is going there secretly to try to find something. I won't spoil what she tries to find as it is an important part of the story.<br /><br />The journey in Americana is quite fun and it almost seems rushed as Jack goes through a lot of adventures in a few pages (specially in the third issue, where they go to different American parts such as Western stories, idyllic stories, among others). The writing keeps being humorous and fun. I really like this story. One of the best so far.<br /><br />The single issue at the end is not that good. The Americana storyline ends on a kind of cliffhanger and having a story where Jack doesn't feature doesn't help out. Usually I welcome the single issue stories that Willingham and Sturges bring our way, and on paper it sounds great to have an issue focus on Gary (the pathetic fallacy), however this issue wasn't as great as other Jack of Fables issues.<br /><br />Overall a good volume, as good as the previous one, but not as good as the second one.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Not Happy After 3 Months: We took out a Bose surround system as we wanted to free up shelf space. The Bose system worked well for us so decided, after reading reviews, to go with this soundbar. Setting it up was tedious. The app could not connect to SB after many retries. My ipad bluetooth could see the SB but the app did not. Called Bose for help. They were suppose to return call. Never did. Finally gave up after several calls. So much for Bose customer support. I had to disconnect everything to remove tv from wall and reposition to make a place for the SB. After plugging in everything and turning on tv the SB was working. So it has worked for a week. Sound is ok but takes some getting used to after surround. The ""full, rich"" sound some reviewers posted is not my experience. Even after all this time it will come on and no sound. Not sure why. This problem persists. For example, we can watch TV at night and it works ok. Next morning, turn it on, no sound. This happens on a regular basis. Our procedure is to turn it on and after it boots up and tv comes on select source. One thing that is bothersome is there is a brief light when you turn it on but does not stay on. I would prefer some indication it is on. So sometime we have to turn on tv speakers to get sound. This is of course irritating considering the cost. I think Bose is coasting on past success.",1.0,Electronics,0,12

"Magnificent storytelling: Having been completely mesmerized by Kristin Hannah‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Nightingale‚Äù, I consciously adjusted my expectations downward when I began reading ‚ÄúThe Great Alone,‚Äù believing it wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as harrowing or as gripping, considering the premise. Boy, was I wrong. This book is every bit as enthralling and heart wrenching as The Nightingale, maybe even more so because the threat to Cora and Leni come from the very person who is supposed to keep them safe.<br /><br />There is such poetry in the language used to tell this story, illuminating the harsh realities of living in the Alaska frontier with a broken, violent man who controls his wife and daughter with brute force and the constant threat of mayhem. The tension in their everyday lives is palpable, brought to life with the author‚Äôs vivid details. I really felt as if I were witnessing each scene as it unfolded, my heart thumping, my mind whirring.<br /><br />The bright star in this saga is Leni. She compelled me to follow her as life keep her unmoored and uncertain, even though her journey was painful to witness at times. After being uprooted from her home too many times to count, she‚Äôs transplanted in the fertile, inhospitable Alaska wilderness with the mother she adores and the father she fears. I really felt for her, for the hopelessness of her situation.<br /><br />Leni‚Äôs love for the beauty and grandeur of Alaska allows her to thrive and put down roots, in spite of her circumstances. Even the commando-style training her Viet Nam vet father forces on her from a very young age serves her well in their harsh environment. Every victory and beautiful moment in Leni‚Äôs life is undermined by her father‚Äôs twisted fear of things seen or imagined. Those scenes are what propel the story to many dramatic climaxes.<br /><br />I loved finding out the background for this incredible saga at the end of the book. The story felt so real and authentic to me, I wasn‚Äôt too surprised to find out that the setting and the details of Alaska had come from Kristin Hannah‚Äôs own experiences while living there. I know that this book will remain with me forever. Bravo and thank you for sharing such a powerful tale with your readers!",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

While the connection is flush - the image doesnt really show that the lines in the center of the item are not actually decorative in fashion - but are instead actual cuts through the coupler. Due to these completely unnecessary cuts its impossible to mount my lead screw to my motor in an upright fashion without it behaving like a spring or slinky - it falls to the side and risks damage to the coupler by bending. This is not a rigid coupler dispite being made of metal - it is very flexible and not good for connecting motors to lead screws due to the flex.,1.0,Unknown,0,32

"***** EYEBALLS & GALAXIES #####: Artwork cheesy? ... THE POWER OF CHEESE! This is what all bands should try to do with the cd artwork. This great package is really FUN and my enjoyment of the band and each release goes up every time (I have all but the first) partly because of their old-school effort to create a mental/visual trip that supports the music, like the great psychedelic albums of the 1960/70's. Not many cds are this DELUXE - Some people are never happy. I doubt they can profit easily after the expense and overall effort that is provided graciously to the fans here.<br /><br />My goodness, this packs a monstrous set of progressive/psychedelic rock balls. What a headtrip generally!  The gradual but beautiful building of energy through each song and to the eventual (75:52 minutes) sci-fi endpoint of the album is like engaging the eyeballs of the universe to get a glimpse of galaxies far away ... DON'T YOU LOVE IT WHEN MUSIC CAN DO THAT?<br /><br />We should accept this fine package for what it is: intense, well-produced/conceived musical artistry that is a pleasure to behold and experience (and a great collectible value as unique visual album art that few bands or record co's would provide at this price).  I am still digesting the album musically, even though I have given it numerous careful (musician) listens. It takes a good long while to explore the nuances of this conceptual infinity knot (song, verse and construction) ... but lyrics would have been helpful considering the thickly layered vocals in parts.<br /><br />My take on this: 10,000 Days is a very cool, unique and special album. Don't rush it, it takes time to absorb for sure. It is a progression of the band taken to new but familiar places (I am intentionally NOT comparing to previous Tool albums, a futile excercise with most great bands; they are all excellent, moody masterpieces). The extra paint on Van Gogh's paintings seemed garish to some fussy people of his day, and Salvador Dali was a little too trippy for most - but we now see them as visionary artists on the cutting edge of their genres (and their oddities endearing).  Aren't we glad they did it their way?  Thank you Tool for going all out to please the fans. Enjoy (late at night)!",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"Sambora Has Great Songs - Odd Cymbal Masks Band: This is a really good effort from Richie Sambora; his guitar playing is excellent but yes a bit too electronically processed on some songs. My big problem is with his drummer's choice of cymbal. One of his cymbals seems like it has rivets or something bouncing around on it; maybe it too is somehow processed electronically, but there seems to be a hissing or shushing coming from the cymbal kit that is masking the really clean and pure sound of Richie's guitar and the rest of the band for that matter, it's like a white noise that covers up the nuances of the guitars instead of supporting them. It sounds like a very high frequency metallic noise that cancels some of the low end impact.<br /><br />Anyway, Richie sounds best when it's just him and his guitar like on the opening of ""I'll Always Walk Beside You"". I think he should do an unplugged blues album next. Or a power blues trio; bass, drums and guitar a la Cream. Other standout cuts for me are ""Taking a Chance on The Wind"" and ""You Can Only Get So High"". Nice Work. Recommended.",4.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

I'm very careful in how I handle my wallet.  After about 5 weeks - a mere handful of uses - the very first page of windows started to separate from the rest.  The tear was more than halfway down the seam.  Luckily I caught it in time or I might have lost those four cards.<br /><br />These were a complete waste of money.

"Good Scares, but Self-Contradictory and Confusing: Good old-fashioned scares are both rampant and effective in this film. The effects, music and cinematography combined to make this a beautifully done film.<br /><br />However, as far as the plot goes, the film contradicts itself. In the movie, the demonologists explain that this was a case of demonic possession, meaning, the entity possessing the house never walked the earth in human form. However, the last half of the movie reveals the fact that a dead witch is haunting the land that was once hers. After establishing the fact that this was a demonic possession, it proceeded to show a haunting by a ghost. (Also, other ghosts possessed the house, all of whom were victims of the witch's crazy antics.)<br /><br />In summation, great scares, but confusing mixed messages. This only weakens the credibility of the statement ""based on true events"". (As if ghosts and demons did not discredit it enough!)",3.0,Movies_and_TV,0,22

"Transforming the Bean Counter...: The book's presentation makes a case for accurate and timely information that is easily understood and actionable.  Whereby it is now time to take the benefits learned from implementing lean manufacturing on the shop floor into the office and remove the blinders of old traditional accounting systems.  Doing so transforms the accountant from bean counter to a valued partner in the business.<br />Discussions include:<br />* a strong section on performance measurement - what the financial team should be measuring in place of current traditional accounting reports.<br />* how to streamline the process and bring about meaningful change<br />* a practical methodology for making the transition away from cost accounting - to go from micro accounting to macro accounting<br />* plain English management financial systems - what they are, why to use, benefits, and how to get them using the one day close method<br />* new concepts in budgeting (the lean budget) and capital planning whereby one looks at reduction in inventory and flexibility instead of per part cost<br />* lean acquisitions - what to do with all that new found cash<br />The final three chapters are my favorite where Jean and Orest take their boardroom management skills and depart wisdom to the reader.  Here it is explained why the CEO and CFO must become active leaders, the benefits of breaking from tradition, and the twelve principles of lean accounting.<br />This is a must read book for everyone who wants to shed the role of bean counter or who has struggled with bean counters and their misunderstanding the accounting side of lean manufacturing.<br />Rick Anderson<br />President<br />TTW Inc. - WinMan software",5.0,Books,1,7

"Good price, awkward fit: I like this for the price they paid, but the cut is a little awkward.  I was confused on how to arrange it after putting it on. I looked at a picture and I still feel like it sits a little funny.  It does not equally cover both sides of your body. It sets more to one side.  I wish there was just a little more length to it. The hanging in the neck is strange.  It does not lay completely flat, but there is not enough loose fabric to make it hang naturally.  That open design on the edging is sort of stamped out of the fabric.  It‚Äôs  more like a rectangular  poncho rather than a square poncho. I just feel like it lays funny. The fringe at the bottom does not go around the entire garment.  But again, I will keep it and wear it for the amount I paid. It was reasonable.  The fabric isn‚Äôt super thin. So that‚Äôs nice.

"Great for the collector, not so great for a kid's toy: Pros:<br />*Great voice acting - he sounds like the real deal and has some variance in what he says as his responses<br />*Sturdy - He holds up well to abuse.  Easily handled getting batted by the dog, sword fighting with my son and running into things while sword fighting himself.<br />*Good animations - He moves around quite well and provides entertainment with his actions<br />*Voice recognition is quite good - he was able to understand the basic commands from a distance and from multiple people quite well<br />*Appearance - He looks very good<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Limited Fun factor - he has so limited of voice commands that it got very old for both my son and myself after the first hour of playing with him.  The only reason it lasted an hour was because the dog was very fascinated with him and made it last a bit longer as we watched him swing his saber at her<br />*Very limited voice command options - With so few things you can command him to do, the boredom sets in quick.  Very few commands give him something you can even use in different situations.  The questions are the only thing that allow replay and even those responses get old quick much like a magic 8 ball.<br /><br />In summary, this toy would make for an excellent collector's item, but for a bit older kids(myself and my 11 yr old son), it got boring very quickly as a toy.  We received this free from BzzAgent and were very excited to play with him as we are both Star Wars geeks.  I do see the potential for it being played with more by a child a bit younger because they don't mind the repetition as much, but the cost to play value is just not there to me.",3.0,Toys_and_Games,0,31

Like all his books, Windmills of the Gods is equipped with a silky yet entrancing writing style  that makes it impossible to put down. In the story, Mary Ashley, a  university professor in Kansas, is appointed ambassador to Romania, which  had only recently ameliorated its relations with the West. Mary receives  much acclaim and over night she becomes one of the most famous and  influential people in the world. However, she finds herself in the middle  of a treacherous web of conspiracy and corrupt power, and many parties are  after her, including one of the most powerful assassins in the world. Even  the reader does not know who Mary should trust as she tries unremittingly  to vanquish the forces that are working against her. You are in for many  shocking surprises as well as great joys and sorrows as you read this book.  It is truly one of the best.",5.0,Books,1,7

"A rollicking good ride!: This is a rollicking good ride. It's a quick, easy, and very entertaining read. I was unfamiliar with this guy and his clam to fame not only as an informant, but as a security guard for a Tea Party candidate that arrested a journalist at a political rally. (Side note: I always wondered how Lisa Murkowski could win a write-in campaign against the guy she lost to in the primary.) I found Fulton's story very interesting and Devon helps him bring the whole thing to life. After I was more than half way through, I did think that perhaps there is a bit of an &#34;unreliable narrator&#34; thing going on. Obviously Fulton is telling his side of the story so it's self-aggrandizing, but at certain parts I couldn't help but wonder if he was just re-imagining history somewhat to make himself look better. (His justification for putting one of those &#34;Obama as the Joker&#34; posters in his store window comes to mind. Basically the whole painting himself as a MSNBC watching, Maddow loving libertarian that worked on Tea Party candidates political campaigns, rings hollow to me, but I suppose Fulton would just throw out a string of f-bombs while telling me he didn't care what I thought.)  Regardless, Fulton is an engaging character and his interplay with his employees at his store is humorous and even heart warming at times.",4.0,Books,1,7

There is something about that that makes me feel that my mouth is still clean long after I gargled. I've had no complaints about my breath since using this, so it must be working as others have. Definitely recommended for the value and for anyone looking for a less-hostile mouthwashing experience.",4.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Finally!  I don't mind ironing..............: I love this iron!  I don't know if it's me working faster but,I believe it's this iron!  I'm going through shirts quickly and believe it's because I only have to iron each area 1 time.  I never realized how many times I was ironing an area to get the wrinkles out.?.  I, also, didn't think the ""nose"" of the iron was that much different but it goes around the upper button and actually leaves the fabric smooth because of the steam holes on the ""nose"".  Previous irons just never got this area totally smooth...  The water lasts me for 2 - 3 shirts and the water ""door"" works fine as long as you open it from both sides.  Wow, the steam!

"When They Work, They're Excellent: These strips work for me about 4 out of 5 times. Sometimes they just don't adhere right or dry right or whatever, and not much gets pulled out. Then it's a waste. I've been using them for years and no matter how much I practice, there is a still a chance that they won't apply right and won't work.<br /><br />When they do work, they're wonderful! I love seeing all the gunk that comes out of my pores that sometimes I go too long without tending. It's like looking at a little mini-city of gunk.

Hijinks just seem to follow Pippa and Gregory seems to be the one to deal with them, from her dressing as a man to escape a horrible marriage offer to serving as Gregory's valet (which you know leads to some very heated moments) this couple is just destined to be together. Gregory is holding a family secret very close to him and he has built some walls around him and Pippa, with her dreams of being a sugar sculpture (really loved this element, almost wish we had seen more of it!) and her determination to only marry for love, form a very unique, bold couple that have much to overcome before true feelings can be explored and delivered on.

"An unbalanced book: To cover the whole war in the front of the East in only one book is an ambitious project, since the pages must be distributed between the military actions, the human dramas, the economy and the world diplomatic context.<br /> Some authors as John Erichson in their books that are the Bible of the WWII, ""The road to Stalingrad"" and ""The road to Berlin"", center almost exclusively on the military aspect, others like Richard Overy in ""Russias war"", do a marvelous summary in a volume with less pages that this one including military, political and human aspects, for me some of the best books on the war in the East, and many other books center only on some battles or on more human aspects.<br />  This book has a considerable extension, but as the author himself admits that it centers especially on the first phase of the war more or less up to Stalingrado, certainly as many other historians do. Of his 687 pages the Stalingrado battle begins in 510, and to the operation Bragation a German defeat major than Stalingrado he dedicates scarcely two pages.The question is why ?<br />  The Germans had been fought  obstinate and fanatically until the end , and the battles after Stalingrado deserve so much or major attention than the first phase of the war where an enemy who attacks for surprise always has advantage. And the Russian victories have major merit on having acted on a prepared and fanatical army. That's why the reduction of the Russian warlike effort in the year 1943, 44 and 45 seems to me  unjust like minimum.<br /> A strong point of this book there are their graphs aumented in the most interesting points and that there considers properly the importance of the battles of Smolensko and Moscow as the first defeats of the Wermacht only a few months after begun the offensive.<br /> I do not like the style of the book it advances very much in the time in a chapter to step back in the following one with another topic and the briefness of the chapters they do not help to a complete vision if there is not a good previous knowledge of the WWII.<br /> Last and not less, the human drama is almost eliminated of his pages, the word holocaust is quoted only once at beginning in general considerations, the genocide of more than three million Russian prisoners of famine by the Germans in 1941 is not nor even mentioned as as they allowed to die of famine to the Russian prisoners in the bag of Stalingrado and many other atrocities not also.<br /> He dedicates more attention to the violations happened in a few months in Germany that to the years of murders, violations, and all kinds of cruelties suffered by the population of the USSR for years, and he even goes so far as to compare the performances of one and another army in this aspect. Thus someone that don't know the WWII's history  should  can think that we are before two similar armies, when the Germans had as end and was exterminating the WHOLE Russian population and it is what they began to do, thing that the Russians did not do when they were in Germany and began to feed the Berlin's population inmediately.<br /> I recommend the book ""Harvest of despair"" of Karel C. Berhoff that details the sufferings of Ukraine under the German rule and since these were acting to depopulate the cities, by means of famine. murders and esclavizaci√≥n and deportation of the population.<br /> This negligence of the human drama, of the holocaust, of the massive murders is one of the principal mistakes of this book from my point of view together with an inadequate chapters writing, nevertheless to irrelevant topics as the bacteriological war that hardly ever went on from a threat he dedicates several paragraphs of the book.<br /> In short an interesting book if the reader have a wide knowledge of the WWII and, like any book, it can always contribute some fact on some topic but deeply unbalanced.",3.0,Books,0,7

"This is NOT your typical ""English escapee living with the funny foreigners"": This is NOT your typical &#34;English escapee living with the funny foreigners&#34;  it tells the tales of real people in timeless situations against a backdrop of another cultural way of life.  Book One was so good and challenging that I thought I wouldn't like the second instalment so much however, as it dealt with different situation for one of the characters who only appeared briefly in the first story, it was a real 'filling in' of the &#34;gaps&#34; in the first one.  The third book begins a little differently and I wondered where it was going but that turned out to have the biggest twist in the tale and was the most heart wrenching of all; like real life, the Village Stories don't always have neat, happy endings!  I have  lived at  various times in  Greek villages, and I really think  Sara Alexi has captured the timelessness of the culture and the pragmatic way villagers deal with changes of 21st century. She tells her tales with warmth and  genuine understanding and compassion laced with the humour that comes from the ridiculous, yet real, situations that people get into!<br />I can't wait to read the rest of the series.",5.0,Kindle_Store,1,20

"Not Good for Papercraft: I bought these because I wanted a good pair of scissors just for some little papercraft projects with lots of detail cutting. I found that since the joint is tightly wrapped in plastic, the cutting action isn't precise enough for that purpose - they left little notches in my detail cuts all over the place. These will make fine everyday scissors, but I wouldn't call these &#34;precision scissors&#34;. At least they've let me set my original scissors with a metal-on-metal joint aside for stuff like this.",2.0,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,0,3

My husband is fairly tall (whereas I am fairly short) and unfortunately the massager does not reach the same levels on him that it does for me. We placed it on a recliner, so the straps are all but useless in that location. Perhaps if it had adjustable straps it could attach to a wider variety of seats (it is a bit too floppy to rest well on the recliner). Overall this was a good purchase, but tall men should be aware that unless they lay the massager on a bed, it will likely not reach their neck.",5.0,Health_and_Household,1,16

"Great wine cooler: Added 1/8/17 - The door has a tendency to not stay shut.  I added a latch and it works fine now (see photos)  The latch is Dreambaby Refrigerator Latch, Silver.  Got lousy reviews because it is a self adhesive latch and falls off after a while, so you will want to anchor it with some small sheet metal screws.<br /><br />Great wine cooler.  Would have given it 5 stars except we had to send the original one back.  It failed to cool after the third day.  The company was very good about the return however, paid for pick up and all shipping.  The new one arrived very promptly and has run flawlessly since.<br />There were comments about excessive noise, but this one is very quiet.  It is in a bar in our family room right by the seating for the TV and hardly noticeable.<br />It says it will store 33 bottles, but will only store 18 regular sized 750 ml wine bottles.  Ours is in a bar and also serves as a refer.  We intended to store sodas (2 liter bottles) and beer in it as well as wine.  Two liter bottles require removing a shelf and even at that, you can only put (2) two liter bottles on one shelf.  Standard 12 oz cans will work pretty well.  You can store 3 rows deep 4 cans across each or 12 cans per shelf.  You can also store standard long neck 12 oz beer bottles, but only one row of 3 per shelf.  The shelf is not long enough for 2 rows, and the wire shelves are a bit too widely spaced in 2 places on each shelf, so will fall through.  You might be able to store a combination of cans and bottles though.  One other consideration if you are going to have it double as a refer is that it will only get to 39 deg, and you may like your sodas a little colder than that.  Great for IPAs or craft beers that you may like a little &#34;warmer&#34; (39 vs 34 degrees from a standard refer)  All in all, it is a good buy, works well and meets our needs.",4.0,Home_and_Kitchen,1,18

"GREED IS A GAME.  PERIOD.: I will say that it's hard to write something like this in today's era; after all, we all decided the truth about Ken Lay and company long long ago, and that makes it hard to read such a book with any kind of objectivity.<br /><br />In spite of this, it's clear that McLean's journey--going way back to her Fortune magazine article questioning Enron's mysteriously inflated value to their eventual demise--shows that her initial suspicion was correct.  The ugliness grows quickly too, as we see certain individuals comforting investors while at the same time selling off their own stocks--all on the same day, no less.  The only thing the book lacked was perhaps a finish line; when we get to the end we hear accounts that this could easily happen again with other corporations, but we're not really shown what we can do as citizens.  Maybe that's not the writer's job, but I feel a sense of disgust in the greed and dishonesty of corporate America and by the end of the book I don't know what to do with it.<br /><br />The question then is evident:  how can a culture prevent such selfish acts when a growing economy is everything and integrity is secondary at best?<br /><br />Until we know that, the problem will only get worse.",4.0,Books,1,7

"Great to have this fun ""Evel Knievel meets Shane"" sci-fi mish-mash flick in a hi-def Blu-ray ...AND in its full uncut version!!!: Always loved this quirky, offbeat film. It's a lot of fun and has good turns by all of the principal actors. Fred Ward is as charming as ever, Peter Coyote is nasty fun as the slick villain, and his dim-witted sidekicks are a hoot. If you've never seen this movie, you're in for a treat. Think of it as Back to The Future meets Silverado. Lots of excitement &amp; thrills, some awesome motocross stuff, gorgeous desert scenery and a thumping rock-synth score by producer Mike (The Monkees) Nesmith. It's enjoyable for all but the youngest viewers; it might be a tad violent for the little ones, so be warned. Shout! Factory has done a nice job with this Blu-ray presentation. The picture looks great, the audio is solid and there are some nice extras thrown in, including director's commentary and an interesting, newly shot &quot;making of&quot; featurette. (Boy, does Mike Nesmith look OLD! LOL) This release is the complete film, too, folks. NOT the crummy edited version that plagued fans for years prior to this Blu-ray. Nice work, Shout! Factory.",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22
"Most comfortable pair of dress shoes I own: I needed something for making Sales visits downtown and walking blocks and blocks.  I've got to say that this is probably the most comfortable pair of dress shoes I own -- even compared to some of my more expensive shoes like my Borns.  Also, they are very different compared to others you will see.  The only drawback to them is that they are somewhat difficult to put on.  They made the strap a little too small to fit comfortably when you're trying to get them on.  They are worth it even though it is more difficult to put on cause once you have them on -- they are like butter on your feet.  Try them!

"Almost there: The Echo 3rd gen is very nice... it most certainly have enough color choices to match my home's various decor.<br /><br />On the functionality front, it is very good as well.  It is still a bit off compared to Google Assistance in terms of some of the voice recognition and answers Alexa can provide but not bad.  The leg up with the Echo is the ring light on it to give passive feedback like a notification or any pending issues.  It would be great if it can be used as a nightlight .  Oh, speaking of notification, I do wish I can see the notification in the Alexa app so I can dismiss it without using my voice to have it read out the notification.<br /><br />And definitely a huge plus for such a small device to integrate with the Ring alarm system to detect glass break and fire/smoke alarm sounds!  I was concerned that Ring doesn't have a glass break sensor but then the home setup tech told me about this feature which is super nice.

"I've used this information pretty much daily since then: I was lucky enough to take 2D design from Professor Mantle about 6 years ago. He wrote this book to cover what he wanted to teach in his class but could not find a book that covered it all in the right way. He did not require us to buy the book but instead provided us with all of the material as hand outs. By the middle of the semester, I realized that this information was priceless and I needed the book as a personal reference book. I actually understood color theory and color wheels for the first time ever!  As an artist, I've used this information pretty much daily since then. And now that I am teaching, I am going to use this book as a reference for my classes.

"ohhh this is dangerous grownup chocolate milk.: This is the variety with LOW sugar sweetened with monk fruit and sucralose. I am a diet pop drinker so I am used to, and prefer diet drinks. Someone who is not might find the taste weird, but it just tastes like regular chocolate milk to me. It is slightly thick, like chocolate milk, not like a protein shake. I could chug one every day for breakfast. Lasts a solid 3-5 hours before I am hungry. Since I tend to not have meat in the house and only occasionally eat it while out, this is a great way for me to get somewhat normal macros AND to tide me over till lunch or mid day. I am a social worker so I tend to get busy and forget to eat till I am famished. I also have chronic migraines so if i forget to eat it's almost a guarantee of a migraine.

But I had to try this out because it was the closet thing to ""just add water"" as I would get. I was disappointed. The texture was much more gritty than I was expecting and I have no idea why. There was also kind of a chalky after taste that I did not like at all. I might give this another shot for biscuits and/or waffles since I already spent the money on this.

"The Consequences of War: The Lost Girls of Paris is a book that is intriguing as it is emotional. With the story being told from both during and after the war, it gives readers a look at the horrors of war and what sacrifices are made in order for one side to win over the other.<br /><br />Grace is trying to build her life again after the war has taken the man that she loves. She works hard to help refugees and the displaced, but it seems to be a never-ending battle. When she ends up with a stranger's suitcase and a pile of women's photos, Grace does what she can to find out who these women are and why they are so important to the owner of the bag.<br /><br />Eleanor is a serious woman who, during the war, is doing what she can to not only help the British win, but to also win something personal for herself--the ability to be a British citizen. Eleanor knows that women can do just as much as men for the war effort, so she heads up a division training women to be spies in France. What she contends with has much consequence for her division, herself, and the fate of the British war effort.<br /><br />The book has a satisfying ending, though you may see it coming early in the story.

"Don't believe the negative comments: Im not much of a review writer but I felt it necessary due to all the other comments. They call it ""The Secret"".. and even though we all know these things (instinct, intuition, the bible, physics, etc), its difficult for anyone to assemble them in a pretty little package and use them in every day life. I have been following ""The Secret"" for years without knowing it. This movie sort of connected the dots and filled in the blanks. I'm a very intelligent, rational person and know this is the real deal. I have personally benefited from whats talked about and it does truly change your life.<br /><br />The comments below are NEGATIVE. and in the movie itself it says that negativity attracts more negativity so if these people have that attitude they will get more of the same. Its just the laws of physics. This is not about money, this is about a spiritual journey to whatever you want in life (its true and it really works). If it were about money there would have been a blockbuster release, sex scenes, a plot, an ending, action, actors, etc.. This has none of the above.

"A Rare and Accurate Find for All Who Wish To Learn More: This book is one of the most detailed, fully researched historically accurate books about the life of Napoleon that I've ever read. As an individual who reads every reasonable and trustworthy book about France and Paris; a true Francophone as well as Francophile, if you will. Therefore, it is truly a rare find when I have stumbled across a book from an author who has put so much diligence into his writing. The life and activities of Napoleon have been either vilified or spoken of with begrudging admiration; yet, my question has always been: &#34;How much of what we know in our present time about Napoleon is accurately written or known?&#34; This book answers much in the gaps and corrects many of the erroneous ideas handed down by spurious writers. I am enjoying a book based on reference material and existing items that give us a glimpse of this titiular character in world history equal to his own hero, Alexander the Great. Admittedly, not every piece of the past is 100% due to the centuries wherein much is lost simply due to the ebbs and flows of real life for anyone. But, for those of you who would enjoy taking a bite out of this deeply enriching and educational book by Mr Roberts, I recommend adding it to your library for either a present or future read.

"Great for Chasing for a Dog Who Likes Soft Toys: **Update** 2 years later, this toy is finally looking faded & starting to break down. I'll be tossing it at the end of the summer. However, I feel that is a great lifespan for a soft dog toy that stayed outside!**<br /><br />Original Review:<br />My Miniature Schnauzer isn't a huge fan of the pool, but he gets in because he likes to hang out with my husband. We thought that since this toy floats, it would be fun to try to get him to swim back & forth, but it turns out he honestly doesn't care about chasing a toy in the pool even if it floats. Instead, he actually really enjoys chasing it like a frisbee in the yard! He didn't like an actual frisbee because it was just a bit large for him to carry back to us. However, he has an affinity for soft toys, as well as an enjoyment of ""nomming"" on toys (he's not a destructive chewer when he chews toys, that's why we call it that, haha!) and this fits that bill - as soft frisbee he can also nom on. Plus if it ends up in the pool, it doesn't sink so we can fish it out easily. So while this may not have fit the original intent for this toy, our dog still loves it!",5.0,Pet_Supplies,1,26

So  approx $125 bucks worth . No complants on that note. What these are absolutely perfect for is under shelf work lights . Cabinet lights and under counter lights . Too bright for kitchen or bathroom . Imo laundry room, sheds , work / hobby areas is where these are best suited. Nice clarity, no flickering and the units the. Selves are so lightweight you  an hang them with double sided tape or velcro with 0 problems.  In fact that would be better then the brackets it came with. ( it's OK they work just fine ) but you have to screw them to whatever youre mousting to. These come with cords that have on/off switches ,limk cords and link connectors.  2200 lumens isn't large shop bright but a great way to add usable light to your work areas  or darker corners with little effort and cost .

"NO MORE MOLD!!!: My water bottle came with a straw lid, and it was always gross! If I didn't clean it daily (minimum weekly), mold would grow on the inside of the straw and get inside the actual bottle itself. I had to order a special water bottle cleaning kit to not only clean the detachable straw, but to also clean the mouth/straw opening. Obviously this became quite a pain, so I searched for a new lid without a straw so that 1) the lid and bottle itself were easier to clean and 2) for overall cleanliness (no straw for mold to grow on)!<br />I found this lid several months ago and here's why I love it:<br />- It fits a standard water bottle size (I have the Fifty Fifty brand, but this would certainly fit a HydroFlask or any other brand so long as you have the standard size and not a kids size)<br />- No leaking<br />- Easy to clean! You can easily clean this bottle with a sponge or wand -- no need for a special water bottle cleaning brush!<br />- NO MOLD!!! This is also because it's easy to waterfall from this lid inside of having to put your mouth (and all the bacteria in your saliva!) directly against the lid<br />- cute color! I got this in pink and I love it!<br />- it comes with two lids! I don't have a 2nd water bottle so I have the 2nd one in my cabinet should anything happen to my current one.<br />- it comes with a ""you got this"" sticker -- love it!",5.0,Sports_and_Outdoors,1,28

"Excellent Spanish Learning CD for Babies and Kiddos: We are trying to be a bilingual household (husband grew up in bilingual household though we speak mostly english in ours). I'm the non-native speaker but minored in spanish in college, so it's important to me that our child grows up bilingual but also speaks proper spanish, not just spanglish! We're only about 6 months in but our child is already showing interest in music so I thought kid's songs in spanish would be a great way to start introducing spanish more into our everyday routine. I've picked up a few CDs that the music was either too fast, songs were too long, or the spanish wasn't easy to repeat. This CD is the opposite- the songs are catchy without being annoying, they are short enough to hold interest, have easy to sing along with melodies, and the spanish is very clear and easy to sing along with. In fact, after playing the CD only twice in the car while running errands, I already have several of the songs memorized enough to sing along to. The songs are also about everyday activities, like brushing your teeth, eating, getting dressed, etc. so it will be easy for me to sing them to our baby when we are doing those daily activities to help reinforce the spanish. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to introduce spanish to their child. would also be great in a preschool setting where spanish is part of the learning experience. We will definitely buy more spanish music cds from this company. Great job!",5.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8
"The most comfortable shoe I own: I bought this shoe on sale, thinking it was a slipper since it has a cloth upper, but once it arrived, it is so comfortable, I wear it all the time, inside and outside.  I love this shoe, not only for its comfort, which is 5-star, but also for its casual good looks. The company Terrasoles is eco-friendly, and packaging and other collaterals are produced on recycled stock with soy inks. The shoe has a removeable, washable insole, which is great for preventing and/or eliminating foot odor.  The only problem, hopefully soon to be solved, is that it's hard to find these shoes, especially in my size, 12m.  When I do find them, I'll buy four or five pairs.

"Somewhat interesting: When I used to subscribe to and read the printed versions of my local newspapers, I always loved reading the obits. In the digital world, my obit reading is dead. One of my favorite genres of literature is biographies, and thus reading about another's life, now public at the death, when my own is lived in anonymity, is interestingly ironic. I am always interested in the age of the deceased, cause of death and their life's work. Needless to say, I found this documentary quite wonderful. I think, talk, pray and hope for an early death nearly everyday. I am not morose, maudlin or melancholy over its inevitability. On the contrary, I could not be more grateful for its existence. I most likely will NOT appear in NYT's obit pages and that is fine with me. However, It sure is fun to read about others who did appear and to be privy to the artful, resourceful and creative way NYT's writers put them there.",4.0,Movies_and_TV,1,22

"Despite being marketed with the others, DOES NOT HAVE PERSONAL FORMS: The way this is marketed on the Amazon site is somewhere between confusing and disingenuous - it is listed alongside all 4 other versions, all of which have the personal tax forms that I'm sure draw 99.9% of shoppers to this page.  This version doesn't have any of the personal forms (e.g. no 1040) also doesn't include a free State e-file.<br /><br />So, just a note to be careful - if you're in a rush and (like me) assume the most expensive one will also include what the less expensive versions do - it does not. This is very clear on the TurboTax website, now that I have gone and looked at it - on that site, they only include the 4 personal versions on their comparison page, and you have to click elsewhere to get to the business one.  But here on Amazon they have not yet realized that that would be more appropriate.",2.0,Software,0,27
"Great Keyboard for the Money: This is an excellent digital piano that works and feels a lot like my Yamaha but costs less. I‚Äôm giving it to my niece to learn on, but here‚Äôs what I liked:<br /><br />For starters the weighted keys feel natural and make playing rather piano-like. The sound is also nicely piano-like. Chords are no problem as this thing has all the polyphony you need. All 88 keys are there, and transitioning from this to an acoustic piano won‚Äôt be difficult.<br /><br />It comes with a sustain pedal, which is the most important pedal especially for beginners. And, as is the case with most of these keyboards, you can hook up headphones and practice without disturbing others. It also has MIDI and audio in and out ports, so there‚Äôs a lot of flexibility here.<br /><br />Build quality feels pretty good. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôd improve in this case. The keyboard is heavy and solid and I expect it will last a long time if treated like a musical instrument and not luggage.<br /><br />What‚Äôs not to like? Not much. To me, this keyboard has the functionality of a Yamaha but at around 100 clams less. If I were a professional musician, I might get the Yamaha just for peace of mind. But this Eastar is more than sufficient, especially for beginners and serious amateurs.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great keyboard and I‚Äôm delighted I can use it to help someone in my family learn piano.",4.0,Musical_Instruments,1,23

"Lift tabs 2 & 3 to form a 90 degree angle at ""Film starting line"": I bought this product because I managed to nick the OEM screen protector and cause air bubbles and gaps.<br />For whatever reason I thought it would be glass and I was wondering how glass is going to cover a curved edge, silly me.<br /><br />I had watched the video prior to ordering the product, and it arrived and I was playing the video while installing. I wasn't watching the video very closely and was more so listening so I got confused and frustrated with the line in the middle. During installation, I thought it would be a ridged plastic, and was desperately trying to get the edges to lay down because I *thought* I followed the instructions correctly. It is very similar to the OEM screen protector, a flexible plastic, the ridged plastic is part of the applicator.<br /><br />Here is where I went wrong:<br />Step 8: 'Pull up the ""Tab 2"", push the ""Squeegee"" from ""Dotted line"" to the top of the phone'<br /><br />If you watch the video very closely, they pulled the screen up past the dotted line and all the way to the ""Film starting line"". I had only pulled the screen up to the dotted line closest to tab 2, no wonder I messed up so badly.<br /><br />Here's my take on step 8: Pull up Tab 2 to create a 90 degree angle at the ""Film starting line"". Push the squeegee from the dotted line closer to Tab 3 towards the top of Tab 2. The clear plastic holding the screen protector should come out from underneath the flexible screen protector and slide out during application.<br /><br />Same with Step 9:<br />Pull up Tab 3 to create a 90 degree angle at the ""Film starting line"". Push the squeegee from the dotted line closer to Tab 2 towards the top of Tab 3. The clear plastic holding the flexible screen protector should come out from underneath the screen protector and slide out during application.<br /><br />I am pretty happy with the purchase as the size is exactly the same as the OEM screen protector. It is a little thinner and slicker than the OEM but not by much.<br /><br />I didn't have to update the fingerprint scanner and it still recognizes my fingerprints. I'm not sure about the durability of the screen protector as I had just applied it.

"The Return of the Political: This is a compelling, if not always entirely convincing book.  Clearly Timothy Brennan has faced a few too many smug graduate students, spouting terms like 'hybridity' and 'difference'to prove their radical bona fides, across the seminar table.  Any one whose been in the social sciences or humanities over the last twenty years probably recognizes the type.  His argument is basically that between the anti-state rhetoric  dominant among this type and the relentlessly identitarian politics they practice, there is little room to talk about political programs, electoral coalitions, and other actual mechanics of political change.  They instead practice a politics of individualized performance, in which the ferocity of one's denunciations of 'hegemonic', 'western' culture, etc. epitomize ones commitments.  He claims this neatly dovetails with the American right, and the wider culture of American liberalism, both of which are also anti-state.  He works through this point in well-researched essays on a variety of figures including Salmon Rushdie, Eric Lott, Hardt and Negri, and Antonio Gramsci.  Although I am predisposed to be a little skeptical of Marxists heatedly denouncing postmodernists, all of the essays are rich enough in the details to overcome the sense that this is more old left whining.  What I found a little less than convincing is Brennan's mapping of performative politics onto the political right, as opposed to programmatic politics which open things up to the left.  Okay, today's 'academic left' is self-indulgent and pseudo radical, true enough.  But this distinction has broader purchase beyond academia. Many of the important political movements of the sixties--from MLK's 'beloved community' to the Weather Underground--had a strong element of performativity, of existentially trying to take a stand and live authentically rather than simply attempt to move a political program forward.  The practice continues up to the present in, for example, the Zapatistas.  Anti-statist notions do have some historical content with the disillusionment with bureaucratic leftist projects.  I don't think these issues will fade any time soon.  And notwithstanding that Brennan hits a number of targets hard, I don't think one can dismiss all those crowded around 'theory' as reactionaries.  Stanley Aronowitz, for example, has had a history of political engagement in the more conventional sense.  Despite these reservations, this book should definitely be read and grappled with.",4.0,Books,1,7

Found the White baby and believe the gods gave her own child back in the white body. It is a tale of a White child growing to manhood within an Indian Tribe.

"Stankowicz on piano: This moody and slow cd of the trumpetplayer Tomasz Stanko is pretty good. Just not good enough for 5 stars, but that doesn't mean you should leave it be.<br /><br />The album has the same atmosphere as (other) ECM piano-albums: melodic and free at the same time, with a lot of slow music on it. The music is subtle and very easy to listen to, but the occasional free-jazz elements restrain it from getting boring.<br /><br />The bass and drum are often used in a percussion-like way, and not in a rhythmic way, just like other ECM-material.<br /><br />Marcin Wasilewski pianoplaying is so present (and good) that I think it's almost more a piano-album than a trumpet-album. And that really is a compliment for Stanko, who leaves room enough for his band to play. Stanko's playing is moody and most of the time very accessible.<br /><br />There's just one thing. When you own more work of the ECM label you can get bored with the same approach over and over again. It that way this album has nothing new to offer, but it's still pretty good.",4.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,1,8

"No Reliability: I bought this blower about a year and a half ago.  Used it for one good season and maybe part of another (mostly summer to blow grass after edging.  Maybe had 10-20 hours at most on the engine.  It would not start last November when I started it up to blow some leave.  Just raked them and ordered new carburetor (after disassembling and inspecting the old one), bought a new spark plug, checked the fuel filter and the kill switch.  Could not for the life of me figure out why I could not get the unit to start.  Bought a spark tester and tested for spark.  Finally this month I took it to a repair guy and he disassembled it and determined that it was not making compression.  The unit was shot.  The engine had failed after no more than 20 hours of operation over 1 year 4 months.  I would not buy this unit again.  I have been reviewing new blowers and it looks like all of them have problems in the area of reliability by the number of reviews that have 1 out of 5.

"Tons of game play that never gets old: My brother describes Vice City as a &quot;part-time job&quot; and I've found this to be true.  You can sit down, finish a mission, work on a few more, do some side jobs as a vigilante or taxi driver, and just roam around town - and before you know it, you've been playing for 4 hours.  The only complaint I have is that it's frozen up on me a few times, one time the tank I stole got stuck on the side of a building and wouldn't go anywhere, I couldn't get out or anything so after 10 minutes of trying everything I could think of, I had to turn the PS2 of and on.  Another thing is sometimes when the &quot;camera&quot; is close to Tommy and he's walking, the change of perspective is skewed and you can end up walking in circles, with just flashes of the wall and his shirt for a bit because you can't tell where you're going.  It's not a big deal unless you are trying to evade gunfire (which you do often) or complete a mission with a time limit.  But the small glitches do not take away from the life of the game, which is amazing.",5.0,Video_Games,1,33

"Am I the only one who found this implausible?: First off, this is not a terrible book. Reading went quickly and there was plenty of stuff happening. It just seemed to demand that you accept far-fetched premises in order to progress through the story. I felt most of the time the main character, Katrina, acted TOO adult, even considering her genius level intelligence. In a few instances, she displays a naivety more believable from a teenager, which seemed to do more justice to a character with her particular past experiences.<br /><br />There are some characters who are dispensed with conveniently in order to move the plot along, and I kept thinking, wow, how coincidental.  Then you have a young teen who is approached by a stranger who seems to know things about her but is not forthcoming with details, yet she never questions it and instead decides it would be a good plan to take off with this biker guy and live with him and his gang.<br /><br />I did think Katrina's struggle to deal with her grief and the trauma of things she witnessed in the company of the biker gang was well crafted and believable. However, the character of Shrug, another key player in the book, did not convince me in his role. He was not a very good actor, and the fact that he pulls it off seems only because that's the way it was written. The character Chad was another one that I couldn't believe was pulling off his role in the book, bumbling as he seemed.<br /><br />If you suspend disbelief, there is enjoyment in this novel as a quick entertaining read. It does have an abrupt ending, though, and leads to sequels, so be prepared to buy a couple more books if you really want to know what happened.",3.0,Unknown,0,32

"Good intentions but not-so-good songs: In the late 60s and early 70s, the Young Disciples organization (not to be confused with the infamous street gang of the Midwest that Prince shouted-out in ""Sign of the Times"") was formed as a musical collective to keep kids in the ghetto of East St. Louis, Illinois off of the streets. Noble idea. Unfortunately, these resulting recordings are simply not that good. Much of it is simply crude, low-budget, poorly recorded  and often poorly -played amateurish jug band funk (as a would-be R&B critic friend of mine used to say) that sounds like bad outtakes from a cross between the Mod Squaud Soundtrack and the Banana Splits.<br /><br />However, as poorly played and mediocre as much of this stuff is, some tunes are interesting at best. The Georgettes had some promising harmonies and Ames Harris' ""People"" is a lyrically interesting litany of ghetto life that predates Grand Mater Flash's ""The Message"" by about a dozen years. Sharon Clark would have made an excellent vocalist with the proper songs and production. ""Country Loving-Country Style"" is a mildly amusing funky blues. That aside, there is not much to recommend this, aside from the good it did in keeping these kids involved in a constructive alternative to street life (as the original rappers tried to do a decade later) and it's nice to know that the Young Disciples hold fond memories of this experience and hold occasional reunions.",2.0,CDs_and_Vinyl,0,8

"Be Aware: Does NOT Fit K350's: Since these replacement eartips are noted to specifically fit my K350's, I had hoped to save time and gas traveling to local stores looking for replacement tips. Although they arrived on time and well packaged, the interior channel on these tips is much to small to fit K350's. I should mention that I am very innovated and mechanically inclined, but no amount of ingenuity will make these fit. The seller has been very accommodating in offering to refund or replace these. However, either requires returning the eartips. While this policy (they said that it is Amazon's policy) is understandable, in view of the value of the eartips and time and inconvenience involved in making a return, it simply isn't worth the effort. So much for an 'easy' replacement purchase. Just the risk involved in Amazon purchases. I'm a frequent Amazon buyer, but this is the first time that I've encountered false/incorrect advertising on a product.

"Randolph mugs are great and broken tops easy to replace: I have about 10 of these and the whole family loves them.  Several of us tuck these into purses or backpacks, so the locking lid gets a lot of use.  Some things handy to know..<br /><br />- when you fill the mug, only fill it to BELOW the bottom of the threads on the base.  If filled too high, it will leak since it doesn‚Äôt seal well.  To test this after you fill it, upend sealed mug over a sink.  If it drips, unscrew it, wipe the outside threaded portion, and close it again.<br />- if you break a top, go to the contigo web site and you can order JUST a locking lid.  Because of their shipping charges, it's best to order multiples (I just ordered 6).  Wish I could order them here in amazon, but as of now, no one sells them here,<br /><br />Everyone in my family used to have different favorite travel mugs to take to work.

Looks decent: The powder is medium in weight and doesn‚Äôt feel as smooth as the newer formulated ones.<br />I will use it but sparingly because it doesn‚Äôt do anything to smooth skin and can leave a slight drying cast if applied to heavily.

"Deep and Dark Beauty meets Beast Romance: This story was captivating from the beginning. I loved the story line and all the characters involved. It took a while to find a good book to read so I am glad I found this book! It is nothing like the story of Beauty and the Beast in my opinion however, there are elements of it. This story is more of a modern rendition. The author did a magnificent job creating a believable story with action and romance.
